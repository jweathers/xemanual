      <h1>FIBRE OPTICS</h1>
      <h2>General</h2>
      <p>The fibre optic system installed uses Media Oriented Systems Transport
         (MOST), which is a multimedia network, optimized for automotive applications.
         Its design allows it to provide a low-overhead and low-cost interface for
         the simplest of devices, such as microphones and speakers. More intelligent
         devices can automatically determine the features and functions provided by
         all other devices on the network and establish sophisticated control mechanisms
         without distracting the driver.
      </p>
      <p>Under normal installation conditions the system is robust and failures
         should not occur. However, since the optical fibres convey data using infra-red
         light, it is vital the passage of light down the fibre is unobstructed. Obstruction
         of infra-red light can be caused by:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Contamination of the fibre ends.</li>
         <li>Damage to the fibre ends.</li>
         <li>Bending, kinking or damaging the cable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
         <b>NOTE: </b>Fibres damaged by kinking or exposure of the optical core due
         to abrasion must be replaced.
      </p>
      <h2>Handling</h2>
      <p>Take special care to avoid damage or contamination when handling or
         working in the vicinity of fibre optic cables and connectors.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
         <b>NOTE: </b>Damage or contamination includes scratches to the cable ends and
         pollution caused by dust, dirt, oil or moisture.
      </p>
      <p class="caution">CAUTION: When handling fibre optic cables cleanliness is of paramount
         importance. The fibre ends should not be touched even with clean bare hands
         as the natural oils deposited from the skin may penetrate the fibre or may
         cause dirt to adhere to the fibre end.
      </p>
      <p>System malfunctions and unnecessary warranty claims can be minimised
         by following these guidelines:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>After disconnection of any cables, carefully install appropriate
            dust caps to protect the mating faces of the connectors from damage or contamination.
            
         </li>
         <li>Avoid introducing tight bends (less than 30mm radius) or kinks
            into the fibre optic cable during service or repair. Tight bends or kinks
            could impair operation, cause immediate system failure, or future system failure.
            
         </li>
         <li>Avoid excessive force, strain or stress on the fibres and
            connectors, especially permanent stress after reinstallation.
         </li>
      </ul>
