<div class="grey-heading">OVERVIEW</div>
</div>
<p>The Gasoline Turbocharged Direct Injection (GTDi) 2.0L petrol engine is an in-line, double overhead camshaft, 4 cylinder engine, which is transverse mounted in the engine compartment. The engine weight is kept to a minimum by using aluminum for the cylinder block, cylinder head and oil pan.</p>
<p>The engine uses a Bosch High Pressure (HP) Direct Injection (DI) fuel system with fuel pressure provided by a HP fuel pump, driven from the exhaust camshaft. The fuel system is a returnless system using 7 hole injectors to supply the cylinders.</p>
<p>The double overhead camshafts use Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT) which allows the timing of the intake and exhaust valves to be adjusted independently of each other. The system is operated by two VCT solenoids which are controlled by the Powertrain Contol Module (PCM) using information from two Camshaft Position (CMP) sensors.</p>
<p>For additional information, refer to: <a href="javascript:window.parent.loadProcedureById('G1895525','G1891945')" data-uid="G1891945" data-proc-uid="G1895525" title="Open the procedure inline and add to opened print list" class="inline-procedure-link">Electronic Engine Controls</a> (303-14B Electronic Engine Controls - GTDi 2.0L Petrol, Description and Operation).</p>
<p>The DI fuel system uses a camshaft driven HP fuel pump to supply a fuel rail with pressurized fuel. The fuel rail delivers fuel at a controlled pressure to all 4 fuel injectors. The DI fuel system, along with advanced piston and combustion chamber design and the turbocharger provide improved fuel consumption and reduced emissions.</p>

<h2>Cylinder Block</h2>
<p>The cylinder block is an aluminum alloy casting with cast-in iron cylinder liners. Oil drain galleries run down the side of the block directing the returning oil away from the crankshaft, returning it to the fluid pan quickly. The galleries prevent the engine oil returning to the oil pan from falling onto the crankshaft, which produces drag.</p>
<p>Oil ways to each main bearing supply oil to lubricate the main bearings and also to supply the connecting rod big end bearings via a cross drilling.</p>
<p>The cylinders are numbered as shown below, with cylinder 1 at the front of the engine:</p>

<p>The balance shaft assembly comprises two eccentric weighted shafts which oppose vibrations created by the engine's rotating components. The balance shafts are driven off a 96 tooth ring gear located on the crankshaft which rotates a 48 tooth driven gear on the driven balance shaft.</p>
<p>The two balance shafts rotate in opposite directions, driven at twice the speed of the crankshaft. The equally sized eccentric weights are phased so that the inertia reaction to their counter-rotation cancels out vibration caused by the engine in both the horizontal and vertical planes.</p>
<p>Rotation of the driven gear is transferred by a second intermediate gear on the driven balance shaft to an idler gear on the idle balance shaft, which rotates at the same speed, but in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The balance shafts are located on split shell bearings which are located in the upper and lower housings. Oil feed from the cylinder block supplies drillings in the lower housing to lubricate the shell bearings and the shafts.</p>
<p>The complete balance shaft assembly is attached to four bosses in the cylinder block by four bolts. Shims are positioned between the four bosses and the balance shaft assembly to obtain the correct meshing of the crankshaft ring gear and the balance shaft driven gear. The balance shaft must also be timed to crankshaft by positioning the crankshaft at Top Dead Center (TDC) and aligning a mark on each balance shaft.</p>

<p>The connecting rods are manufactured from forged powder metal and have fracture split big end caps to ensure precision re-assembly for bearing shell alignment.</p>
<p>There are a number of grades of large end bearing available, each being color coded. By measuring the crankshaft pin journal and the large end diameter of the connecting rod, the correct thickness large end bearing shells can be selected to give the optimum clearance.</p>
<p>A choice of three piston diameters are available. The diameter of each piston is measured and precisely matched to each cylinder bore diameter. Each piston has a grade number, 1, 2 or 3, which corresponds to its measured diameter.</p>
<p>The connecting rod and piston are marked to ensure correct assembly with the marks facing the front of the engine. The top face of piston has an arrow which must also point towards the front of the engine.</p>

<p>The piston crown has a recess for stabilisation of the fuel/air mixture. The recess is used together with the geometry of the intake path to optimise the transport of the intake air and the injected fuel to the spark plug.</p>
<p>The combustion chamber is enlarged by the piston recess. The piston has been finished in such a way that a compression surface is formed on the exhaust side of the piston crown. This compression surface is used to compensate for the material missing from the piston recess allowing the compression ratio to be achieved.</p>

<p>The engine oil cooler and filter assembly is located at the left side rear of the engine. The assembly comprises the oil filter element, a filter adaptor plate and the cooler.</p>
<p>The adaptor plate is attached to the cylinder block with four bolts and sealed with a gasket. The adaptor plate has a threaded port for location of the oil pressure sensor. The water cooler is located on the top of the adaptor plate and is sealed with a molded rubber gasket and secured with a bolt. The oil filter is a conventional cartridge type design with a threaded central port which screws onto a threaded boss on the adaptor plate.</p>
<p>Engine coolant returning from the heater core flows, via a hose, into the oil cooler and circulates around the body of the cooler before exiting via another hose to the thermostat housing. The engine coolant circulation draws heat from the cooler body which is generated by the hot engine oil.</p>
<p>Engine oil is directed from the cylinder block and into the adaptor plate. The oil circulates through galleries in the adaptor plate losing its heat via the plate body. The oil is then directed via the central threaded boss into the oil filter cartridge. The oil flows through the filter elements and out of the filter cartridge via a number of holes to the adaptor plate and then back into the cylinder block.</p>

<p>The front crankshaft pulley is located on the end of the crankshaft and secured with a washer and bolt. The pulley drives the auxiliary drive belt for the ancillary components and incorporates a vibration damper and the trigger wheel for the Crankshaft Position (CKP) sensor.</p>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTE:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<p>If the front pulley is removed, the engine must be set and held at Top Dead Center (TDC) to maintain the engine timing. The Damper is not keyed and relies on friction (Diamond washers) to guarantee timing)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The pulley incorporates an integral vibration damper which dampens vibration in the crankshaft produced by the combustion process. Each time a cylinder fires, torque is applied to the crankshaft via the pistons and connecting rods. The crankshaft deflects in reaction to the torque which creates a vibration when the torque is dissipated. The vibration damper absorbs the vibration reducing fatigue damage to the crankshaft.</p>
<p>The trigger wheel to the crankshaft position sensing is located on the rear of the pulley. The wheel has 58 teeth with a 2 teeth missing which in conjunction with the CKP enable the Powertrain Contol Module (PCM) to determine the rotational speed and position of the crankshaft. The position of the trigger wheel in relation to the crankshaft position is critical and special tools and procedures are required to obtain the correct correlation of the components.</p>

<p>The oil pump is an eccentric rotor type pump and is attached to the cylinder block with four bolts. The input shaft of the oil pump is driven from the front of the crankshaft by a chain drive at crankshaft speed.</p>
<p>The oil pump draws oil from the oil pan through a filter and pick-up which is attached to the input port of the oil pump.</p>
<p>The oil is pressurized and pumped from the pump body into an oil gallery in the cylinder block. The oil is then direct through the oil cooler, filtered by the replaceable cartridge filter and distributed through oil galleries in the cylinder head and cylinder block. All moving parts are lubricated by pressure or splash oil. Pressurized oil is also provided for the cam and oil pump chains and tensioners and guides.</p>
<p>A Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) is located within the pump body and relieves excess oil pressure back into the pump body to be recirculated through the pump.</p>

<p>The simplex camshaft timing chain is an endless roller chain which is driven by a gear on the crankshaft. The chain is passed over the two gears which are integral with the Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT) actuators on the end of each camshaft.</p>
<div class="wcn-container">

</div>
</div>
<p>A fixed camshaft timing chain guide is fitted to the intake side of the engine and secured with two bolts. A tensioner arm guide is fitted to the exhaust side of the engine and is attached with a pivot pin at its upper end. A camshaft timing chain tensioner is fitted to the lower end of the tensioner arm and applies a controlled tension to the chain. This maintains the chain at the correct tension and also allows for and dampens backlash in the chain tension due to deceleration. The chain and tensioner are maintenance free components.</p>
<p>The tensioner has a hole which allows for the locking of the tensioner to facilitate removal of the tensioner arm, guide or camshaft timing chain. The tensioner plunger can be pushed back into the housing and a pin inserted to lock it in the retracted position.</p>
<p>The tensioner is also responsible for lubrication of the timing chain. The tensioner is mounted in the oil pressure gallery on the cylinder block which also supplies pressurized engine oil to the turbocharger. Pressurized oil is passed through the tensioner body and into a drilling in the center of the tensioner plunger. The pressurized oil is ejected from a small hole in the end of the tensioner plunger and passed though a corresponding hole in the tensioner arm and apples engine oil to the chain.</p>

<p>The timing of the intake and exhaust camshafts can be adjusted independently by an electro-hydraulic controlled Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT) system. The PCM controls the system using information from the Camshaft Position (CMP) sensors and the Crankshaft Position (CKP) sensor.</p>
<p>The VCT actuators are located on the end of each camshaft and are secured with diamond friction washers and bolts to threaded holes in each camshaft. No keyway is used to maintain the timing of the VCT actuator to the camshaft position; the diamond friction washers lock the actuator in position. The friction washers can only be used once and must be replaced if the actuators are removed.</p>
<p>The VCT actuators are operated by VCT solenoid valves. The solenoid valves are controlled by the PCM to control the flow of pressurized engine oil to the actuators.</p>

<p>The exhaust camshaft Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT) actuator has three hydraulic chambers. Six return springs are used to ensure the camshaft drive gear is returned to the 'home' position as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The three chambers allow hydraulic pressure to act on the central piston. The pressure is effectively directed into the three chambers and consequently applied to the three 'pistons' which are moved by the pressurized engine oil when advance or retard adjustment is required. The pressurized engine oil is supplied from the engine oil pump. The flow of the oil to the actuator is controlled by the VCT actuator solenoid valve which in turn is controlled by the PCM.</p>
<p>When advance or retard of the camshaft timing is required, the solenoid valve directs the pressurized engine oil into one side or the other of the central piston chambers. The central piston is attached directly to the camshaft. The hydraulic effect of the oil rotates the camshaft in relation to the outer gear of the VCT actuator, therefore changing the valve timing. Springs within the unit assist the camshaft to quickly return to the normal operating position assisted by hydraulic pressure being applied to the opposite side of the piston.</p>

<p>Two Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT) actuator valve solenoid valves are used; one for the intake camshaft and one for the exhaust camshaft. The solenoid valves are located in the top of the camshaft cover and are secured with a bolt and sealed with O-ring seals assemblies.</p>
<p>The solenoid valves are located in holes in the front camshaft bearing cap. The bearing cap contains drillings which direct pressurized engine oil to the valve control ports. The pressurized engine oil is supplied through a central bore in the bearing cap. The bore contains a filter to remove any debris from the oil to avoid contamination of the solenoid valves spools. The oil passes through the filter and is directed via drilling to each solenoid valve spool.</p>
<p>The valve spool is moved by the solenoid which is actuated by Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals from the PCM.</p>
<p>Each VCT actuator solenoid valve contains a coil and an armature. The PCM actuates the solenoid with a PWM of up to 300 Hz. The solenoid valve is controlled linearly over its operating range from 0 to 1000 mA. Approximately 560 mA is required to hold the valve in the neutral position so the oil supply to the retard and advance adjustment control ports are closed.</p>
<p>If the PCM detects a fault with one or both VCT actuator solenoid valves, the PCM will not operate them and therefore VCT operate will be disabled and the camshaft will operate in their default position.</p>

<p>The High Pressure (HP) fuel pump is located at the rear of the engine and is driven off the exhaust camshaft. The pump is mounted on a cover assembly and secured with two bolts. The cover assembly is attached to the cylinder head, sealed with a gasket and secured with four studs.</p>
<p>The extended end of the exhaust camshaft protrudes through a hole in the end of the cylinder head. A three lobe cam on the end of the camshaft locates inside the fuel pump cover and drives a plunger attached to the piston of the fuel pump.</p>
<p>Because the high pressure fuel pump is driven off the engine exhaust camshaft by a three lobe cam, the piston of the pump cycles at 1.5 times the engine rpm. (Engine camshaft turns at one-half engine rpm multiplied by three for the number of lobes on the exhaust camshaft).</p>
<p>A shield is fitted to the fuel pump to protect it from damage and an acoustic cover is fitted over the pump to dampen pump operating noise.</p>

<p>The High Pressure (HP) fuel pump is a single cylinder pump which meters the fuel pressure according to demand requirements for correct fuel injection. The delivery rate of the fuel pump is adjustable by means of a fuel metering valve which is controlled by the PCM.</p>
<p>The high-pressure pump is mechanically driven by the camshaft via a plunger. A tappet on the end each plunger is operated by a three-lobe cam on the camshaft. A spring installed on the outside of the plunger ensures the plunger and tappet remain in contact with the cam. During the downward stroke of the pump piston, fuel is delivered to the cylinder at a pressure supplied by the fuel tank mounted low pressure fuel pump. On the upward stroke of the piston the fuel in the cylinder is compressed. If the pressure from the pump exceeds the pressure in the fuel rail the fuel is delivered into the fuel rail via the high pressure outlet and a pipe.</p>
<p>The cylinder and Low Pressure (LP) fuel supply are connected via the fuel metering valve. If the fuel pressure in the fuel rail is sufficient, the PCM opens the metering valve during the compression stroke of the piston, decaying the pressure and directing the fuel from the cylinder back into the LP supply. A non-return valve is located between the fuel rail and the high pressure pump to prevent pressure dropping in the fuel rail due to fuel metering valve operation. The delivered fuel quantity depends on the engine speed and the actuation of the fuel metering valve.</p>
