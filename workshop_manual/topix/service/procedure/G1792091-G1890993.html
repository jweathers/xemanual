<div class="caution-alert">CAUTION:</div>
<div class="caution-box">
<p>Diagnosis by substitution from a donor vehicle is <span class="bold-black">NOT</span> acceptable. Substitution of control modules does not guarantee confirmation of a fault, and may also cause additional faults in the vehicle being tested and/or the donor vehicle.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTES:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<ul class="wcn-list">
<li>
<p>If a control module or a component is suspect and the vehicle remains under manufacturer warranty, refer to the Warranty Policy and Procedures manual, or determine if any prior approval programme is in operation, prior to the installation of a new module/component.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generic scan tools may not read the codes listed, or may read only 5-digit codes. Match the 5 digits from the scan tool to the first 5 digits of the 7-digit code listed to identify the fault (the last 2 digits give extra information read by the Jaguar Land Rover approved diagnostic equipment).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When performing voltage or resistance tests, always use a digital multimeter that has the resolution ability to view 3 decimal places. For example, on the 2 volts range can measure 1mV or 2 K Ohm range can measure 1 Ohm. When testing resistance always take the resistance of the digital multimeter leads into account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check and rectify basic faults before beginning diagnostic routines involving pinpoint tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inspect connectors for signs of water ingress, and pins for damage and/or corrosion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If DTCs are recorded and, after performing the pinpoint tests, a fault is not present, an intermittent concern may be the cause. Always check for loose connections and corroded terminals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check DDW for open campaigns. Refer to the corresponding bulletins and SSMs which may be valid for the specific customer complaint and carry out the recommendations as required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical damage to the sensor (impact damage or scratched sensor surface) must NOT be changed under warranty.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The table below lists all Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) that could be logged in the Parking Assist Control Module (PACM).
