<p>In order to prevent damage to the battery and make sure that a satisfactory service life, all processes detailed within this document must be rigorously adhered to.</p>
<p>It is equally important therefore to note the following key points: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>All new vehicles leave the factory with either a transit relay installed and/or have a transit mode programmed into the vehicle control modules. The transit relay must be removed and the transit mode disabled (where applicable) using a Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) approved diagnostic equipment, not more than 72 hours before the customer takes delivery.</li>
<li>The battery can be discharged by the following mechanisms:<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li class="dash-subitem">Self Discharge: - A lead acid battery will very slowly discharge itself due to its own internal chemical processes whether it is connected to a vehicle or not.</li>
<li class="dash-subitem">Quiescent Discharge: - The vehicle electrical systems when connected to the battery will draw charge from the battery.</li>

<p>12 Volt Lead Acid Batteries rely on internal chemical processes to create a voltage and deliver current. These processes and the internal chemical structure of the battery can be damaged if the primary battery is allowed to discharge over a number of weeks/months, or is left in a discharged state for a lengthy time period.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>On vehicles with conventional ignition keys , these must not be left in the ignition lock barrel when the transit relay has been removed, otherwise quiescent current will increase and the battery will discharge more rapidly.</li>
<li>For keyless vehicles, the Smart Key must be stored at least 5m (16 ft) away from the vehicle when the vehicle is parked or stored.</li>
<li>AGM Batteries are fully sealed and cannot have the electrolyte level topped up.</li>
</ul>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTE:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<p>Retailers involved in the storage/handling of vehicles and replacement batteries have a responsibility to make sure that only a fully charged battery may be processed through the distribution selling chain.</p>

<h2>2.3 Extended Vehicle Rework </h2>
<p>For any extended vehicle rework that results in consuming vehicle battery power a Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) approved battery support unit should be connected, refer to : Battery Support Unit connection procedure (414-00 battery and charging system - General information, General procedures).</p>
<h2>2.4 Jump Starting New vehicles before they have been delivered to the customer</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>It is the retailers responsibility to make sure the primary battery is not allowed to discharge by following the instructions and processes defined in this manual.</li>
<li>However, if circumstances dictate that a new vehicle must be jump started due to a discharged primary battery whilst the vehicle is in the retailers care. The primary battery on this vehicle must be replaced with a new primary battery prior to delivery to the customer at the retailers liability.</li>
<li>The vehicle should also undergo investigation as to why the primary battery became discharged.</li>
<li>Do not connect the jump starting cable to the negative (-) terminal of the primary battery. Always connect to the recommended earth point, as defined in the owners handbook or service documentation for the vehicle.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.5 AGM Batteries</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>AGM batteries must not be charged to more than 14.8 Volts. Charging to more than 14.8 Volts will damage the AGM batteries.</li>
<li>AGM Batteries must be tested with a capable battery tester as detailed in the Equipment section (Section 5) of this procedure.</li>
</ul>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTE:</div>
<div class="note-box">

<div class="grey-heading">3. HEALTH AND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS</div>
</div>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="warning-alert">WARNINGS:</div>
<div class="warning-box">
<ul class="wcn-list">
<li>
<p>LEAD ACID BATTERY CELLS CONTAIN SULPHURIC ACID AND EXPLOSIVE MIXTURES OF HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN GASES. IT IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL THAT THE FOLLOWING SAFETY PRECAUTIONS ARE OBSERVED.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lead acid batteries emit highly explosive hydrogen at all times, particularly during charging. To prevent any potential form of ignition occurring when working in the vicinity of a lead acid battery:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" class="wcn">
<li>Do not smoke when working near batteries.</li>
<li>Avoid sparks, short circuits or other sources of ignition in the lead acid battery vicinity.</li>
<li>Switch off current before making or breaking electrical connections.</li>
<li>Make sure that the battery charging area is well ventilated.</li>
<li>Make sure that the charger is switched off when: a) connecting to a lead acid battery; b) disconnecting from the lead acid battery.</li>
<li>Always disconnect the ground cable from the battery terminal first and reconnect it last.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lead acid batteries contain poisonous and highly corrosive acid. To prevent personal injury, or damage to clothing or the vehicle, the following working practices should be followed when topping up, checking electrolyte specific gravity, removal, refitting or carrying lead acid batteries:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" class="wcn">
<li>Always wear suitable protective clothing (an apron or similar), safety glasses, a face mask and suitable gloves.</li>
<li>If acid is spilled or splashed onto clothing or the body, it must be neutralized immediately and then rinsed with clean water. A solution of baking soda or household ammonia and water may be used as a neutralizer.</li>
<li>In the event of contact with the skin, drench the affected area with water. In the case of contact with the eyes, bathe the affected area with cool clean water for approximately 15 minutes and seek urgent medical attention.</li>
<li>If battery acid is spilled or splashed on any surface of a vehicle, it should be neutralized and rinsed with clean water.</li>
<li>Heat is generated when acid is mixed with water. If it becomes necessary to prepare electrolyte of a desired specific gravity, slowly pour the concentrated acid into water (not water into acid), adding small amounts of acid while stirring. Allow the electrolyte to cool if noticeable heat develops. With the exception of lead or lead-lined containers, always use non-metallic receptacles or funnels. Do not store acid in excessively warm locations or in direct sunlight.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due to their hazardous contents, the disposal of batteries is strictly controlled. When a battery is scrapped, make sure that it is disposed of safely, complying with local environmental regulations. If in doubt, contact your local authority for advice on disposal facilities. </p>
