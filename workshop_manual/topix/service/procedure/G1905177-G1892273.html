<div class="grey-heading">OVERVIEW</div>
</div>
<p>Depending on model specification and market, the vehicle may incorporate auxiliary heating in the form of a Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH). The FFBH boosts the temperature of the engine coolant supplied to the climate control assembly.</p>
<p>Fuel for the FFBH is taken from the vehicle fuel tank, through a fuel line attached to the fuel pump module. A FFBH fuel pump supplies the fuel at low pressure to the FFBH. In the FFBH, the fuel is burned and the resultant heat output is used to heat the engine coolant, which is circulated through the climate control assembly by a FFBH coolant pump.</p>
<p>FFBH operation is automatic while the engine is running. Where timed climate control is incorporated, the FFBH can be selected to operate (depending on the ambient air temperature) while the vehicle is parked using the Touch Screen (TS) or a remote control.</p>
<p>Vehicles with timed climate control also incorporate:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>A FFBH receiver for communication with the remote control.</li>
<li>A changeover valve that allows the climate control coolant circuit to be isolated from the engine coolant circuit to reduce the warm up time of the passenger compartment.</li>

</div>
<p>The Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH) is located in the engine compartment, in front of the front left wheel, behind the bumper. The FFBH is connected in series with the coolant supply to the climate control assembly. A flylead on the FFBH connects it to the vehicle wiring.</p>
<p>The FFBH consists of the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The Fuel Fired Booster Heater Control Module (FFBHCM)</li>
<li>A combustion air fan</li>
<li>A combustion chamber</li>
<li>A heat exchanger</li>
<li>A coolant pump</li>
<li>An air intake hose and silencer</li>
<li>An exhaust pipe and silencer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fuel Fired Booster Heater Control Module (FFBHCM)</h2>
<p>The Fuel Fired Booster Heater Control Module (FFBHCM) controls and monitors operation of the Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH) system. Power for the FFBHCM is provided by a permanent power feed from the Quiescent Current Control Module (QCCM). A Local Interconnect Network (LIN) bus connection provides the communication link between the FFBHCM and the HVAC Control Module.</p>
<p>The FFBHCM also has:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>A ground connection</li>
<li>Power feed and ground connections with the FFBH coolant pump</li>
<li>A power feed connection with the FFBH fuel pump</li>
<li>A signal line connection with the FFBH receiver on vehicles with timed climate control only.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Combustion Air Fan</h2>
<p>The combustion air fan regulates the flow of air to the heater so as to ensure correct combustion. If the heater is operational while the engine is stopped or the heater enters the control idle phase, the air fan will continue to run in order to cool the combustion chamber in readiness for the next required start. The operation of the fan may be noticed during this process. This is perfectly normal.</p>
<h2>Combustion Chamber</h2>
<p>The combustion chamber is located in the heat exchanger casing and the combustion air fan casing. The fuel feed pipe of the combustion chamber extends up through the cover of the combustion air fan. A glow plug is installed in the combustion chamber to provide the ignition source for the fuel and air mixture.</p>
<h2>Heat Exchanger</h2>
<p>The heat exchanger transfers heat generated by the combustion chamber to the engine coolant. An overheating temperature sensor and a surface temperature sensor are installed in the heat exchanger and connected to the control module. The control module uses the temperature inputs to control system operation.</p>
<h2>Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH) Coolant Pump</h2>
<p>The Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH) coolant pump is an electric pump, the pump's intake is connected to either the heater coolant feed from the engine (on vehicles without timed climate control) or to the FFBH changeover valve (on vehicles with timed climate control). A hose, which incorporates a bleed screw, connects the outlet of the coolant pump to the coolant inlet of the FFBH.</p>
<p>The coolant pump runs continuously while the FFBH is in control idle or active operating modes. While the FFBH is inactive, coolant flow is reliant on the engine coolant pump.</p>
<h2>Air Intake Hose and Silencer</h2>
<p>A canister type silencer and filter is incorporated into the air intake hose.</p>
<h2>Exhaust Pipe and Silencer</h2>
<p>The exhaust pipe and silencer directs exhaust combustion gases to atmosphere below the vehicle. Exhaust vapor may be visible when the Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH) is running, depending on atmospheric conditions. Under normal operating conditions, the exhaust vapor will subside once the FFBH has achieved 'Power status' and the exhaust pipe has reached normal operating temperature.</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, for example after heater replacement or the disconnection of the fuel or coolant circuits, smoke may be visible from the general vicinity of the heater rather than the outlet of the exhaust. This may be as a result of residual fuel or coolant on the exhaust or heater body as a result of the service procedure. Under these circumstances, the heater must be run continually for 15-20 minutes until there are no signs of excessive smoke.</p>

</div>
<p>The Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH) fuel pump is installed in a rubber mounting. The pump is a self-priming solenoid operated plunger pump. The FFBHCM outputs a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal to control the operation of the pump. When the pump is de-energized, it provides a positive shut-off of the fuel supply to the FFBH.</p>

</div>
<p>On vehicles with timed climate control, the Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH) changeover valve is attached to a bracket on the FFBH. The FFBH changeover valve is a normally open solenoid valve installed between the supply and return sides of the heater coolant circuit. When de-energized, the changeover valve connects the heater coolant circuit to the engine coolant circuit. When energized, the changeover valve isolates the heater coolant circuit from the engine coolant circuit.</p>
<p>Operation of the changeover valve is controlled by a power feed from the HVAC Control Module.</p>

<p>The Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH) receiver translates the FFBH remote control radio signals, relayed from the FFBH antenna amplifier, into a voltage output to the FFBH. When a request for timed climate control is received, the FFBH receiver outputs a battery power feed to the FFBH unit. When a request to switch off timed climate control is received, the FFBH receiver disconnects the power feed.</p>
<p>The FFBH receiver has a permanent power feed from the Passenger Junction Box (PJB) and is connected to the antenna amplifier by a coaxial cable. For additional information, refer to: Antenna (415-01 Information and Entertainment System, Description and Operation).</p>

<p>The Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH) remote control enables the timed climate control program to be activated and deactivated from outside the vehicle. The remote control has an approximate range of 100 m (328 ft). There is no need to point the remote control at the vehicle. Press and hold the ON button for approximately 2 seconds. The Light Emitting Diode (LED) illuminates green to confirm that a timed climate program has been initiated. The LED continues to flash for a few seconds to indicate that the timed climate is active.</p>
<p>The timed climate program continues for 20-30 minutes, after which it switches off automatically to prevent the vehicle battery from discharging. It also turns off automatically if the engine is started.</p>
<p>The LED indicator signals various states and conditions for the timed climate as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Illuminates green when the ON button is pressed and then quickly flashes green, to indicate that heater operation has been requested.</li>
<li>Illuminates green followed by red when the OFF button is pressed, to indicate that the heater has been requested to shut down.</li>
<li>Illuminates green and then quickly flashes red when either the ON or OFF button is pressed, to indicate that there is no communication with the receiver. This normally occurs if the vehicle is too far away.</li>
<li>Illuminates green and then slowly flashes red when either the ON or OFF button is pressed, to indicate that there is an error.</li>
<li>Flashes red when either the ON or OFF button is pressed, to indicate that the timed climate remote battery needs replacing.</li>
</ul>

<p class="pf-title"> Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH) Remote Control Pairing</p>
<p>Each Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH) remote control must be 'paired' to the FFBH receiver to enable communications. Each remote control has a unique identification number which is stored by the receiver. The receiver can store up four remote control identification numbers. If a fifth remote control is paired to the receiver, the receiver will overwrite the first paired remote control number.</p>
</div>
<p>Pair a remote control to the vehicle, as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove fuse F1 (5A) from the Passenger Junction Box (PJB).</li>
<li>Wait for a minimum of 5 seconds.</li>
<li>Replace fuse F1 (5A) in the PJB then, within 5 seconds, press and hold the remote control OFF switch.</li>
<li>A successful pairing is indicated by the remote control Light Emitting Diode (LED) illuminating red for 2 seconds.</li>
</ol>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTE:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<p>The pairing process relies on the FFBH receiver having the power supply removed and then the power supply re-instated. The fuse method is the easiest method but it can also be achieved by battery disconnection or removal of the harness connector from the FFBH receiver.</p>

<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">OPERATION</div>
</div>
<h2>Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH)</h2>
<p>Operation of the Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH) is controlled by a status message from the HVAC Control Module to the Fuel Fired Booster Heater Control Module (FFBHCM). A similar status message, from the control module to the HVAC, advises the HVAC of the current operating status of the FFBH.</p>
<p>While the engine is running, if the ambient air temperature is less than 12 &deg;C (54 &deg;F) (on vehicles with diesel engine) or 1 &deg;C (34 &deg;F) (on vehicles with petrol engine) and the engine coolant temperature is less than 75 &deg;C (167 &deg;F) the HVAC changes the status message from 'heater off' to 'supplemental heat'. The FFBHCM then changes the status message it sends the HVAC to 'supplemental heat' and starts the FFBH.</p>
<p>If the engine is started and the FFBH is requested, the HVAC closes the recirculation door for the first 4 minutes or until the vehicle road speed exceeds 16 km/h (10 mph), after which time the HVAC opens the door to enable the ingress of fresh air. This feature is overridden if the MAX demist switch on the Integrated Control Panel (ICP) is selected or if the HVAC detects a risk of misting of the windshield.</p>
<p>The FFBH will not start, or will discontinue operation, if any of the following occur:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li> The FFBHCM is in the error lockout mode (see DIAGNOSTICS below). </li>
<li>The engine stops running for approximately 4 seconds. The time delay is included for stall detection.</li>
<li>The HVAC receives a 'fuel cut-off' message from the Body Control Module/Gateway Module (BCM/GWM) assembly on the High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) comfort systems bus. The BCM/GWM assembly sends the message if it receives a crash signal from the Restraints Control Module (RCM). For additional information, refer to: <a href="javascript:window.parent.loadProcedureById('G1818071','G1892738')" data-uid="G1892738" data-proc-uid="G1818071" title="Open the procedure inline and add to opened print list" class="inline-procedure-link">Airbag Supplementary Restraint System</a> (501-20B Supplementary Restraint System, Description and Operation).</li>
<li>The HVAC receives a low fuel level message from the BCM/GWM assembly on the HS CAN comfort systems bus.</li>
<li>The Quiescent Current Control Module (QCCM) disconnects the power supply to the Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH). For additional information, refer to: <a href="javascript:window.parent.loadProcedureById('G1818009','G1892350')" data-uid="G1892350" data-proc-uid="G1818009" title="Open the procedure inline and add to opened print list" class="inline-procedure-link">Battery and Cables</a> (414-01 Battery, Mounting and Cables, Description and Operation).</li>
</ul>
<p>If the FFBHCM does not start the FFBH, or discontinues operation, the status message to the HVAC remains at, or changes to, 'heater off'.</p>
<p>If the ambient air temperature increases to 15 &deg;C (59 &deg;F) on vehicles with diesel engine, or 4 &deg;C (40 &deg;F) on vehicles with petrol engine, or the engine coolant temperature increases to 85 &deg;C (185 &deg;F), the HVAC cancels supplemental heating, by changing the status message to the FFBHCM back to 'heater off'. The FFBHCM then cancels FFBH operation and changes the status message to the HVAC to 'heater off'.</p>
<h2>Start Sequence</h2>
<p>At the beginning of a start sequence, the FFBHCM energizes the FFBH coolant pump then operates the following in a preset sequence to start the FFBH:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The combustion air fan</li>
<li>The glow plug</li>
<li>The FFBH fuel pump.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once combustion has stabilized the FFBHCM switches off the glow plug. If the FFBH fails to ignite the FFBHCM repeats the start sequence.</p>
<h2>Combustion Loads</h2>
<p>While the FFBH is running, the FFBHCM cycles between power load, high or low load combustion and a control idle phase of operation, depending on the temperature of the coolant in the heat exchanger. The heat output level at low load combustion is 2.3 kW. This rises to 5 kW at high load combustion and 5.2 kW at power load combustion. The FFBHCM transmits the amount of fuel used by the FFBH to the BCM/GWM assembly, and the FFBH coolant temperature to the HVAC Control Module.</p>

<p>The switching point temperatures are for reference only and may vary depending on the fuel type and engine size.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>After the start sequence, the FFBHCM maintains power load combustion until the coolant temperature reaches switching point temperature 1. At this temperature, the FFBHCM decreases the speed of the FFBH fuel pump and the combustion air fan to enable high load combustion. The FFBHCM maintains high load combustion while the coolant temperature remains between switching point temperatures 2 and 6. At high load combustion the temperature of the coolant will increase or decrease depending on the amount of heat required to heat the vehicle interior. If the coolant temperature decreases to switching point temperature 6, the FFBHCM increases the speed of the FFBH fuel pump and the combustion air fan to full speed, to return to power load combustion. If the coolant temperature increases to switching point temperature 2, the FFBHCM decreases the speed of the FFBH fuel pump and the combustion air fan to enable low load combustion. At low load combustion the temperature of the
			coolant will again increase or decrease depending on the amount of heat required to heat the vehicle interior. If the coolant temperature decreases to switching point temperature 5 the FFBHCM increases the speed of the FFBH fuel pump and the combustion air fan to enable high load combustion. If the coolant temperature increases to switching point temperature 3, the FFBHCM enters a control idle phase of operation.</p>
<p>On entering the control idle phase, the FFBHCM immediately switches the FFBH fuel pump off, to stop combustion, and starts a timer for the combustion air fan. After a 90 seconds (diesel vehicles) or 120 seconds (petrol vehicles) cool down period, the FFBHCM switches the combustion air fan off and then remains in the control idle phase while the coolant temperature remains above switching point temperature 4. If the coolant temperature decreases to switching point temperature 4, the FFBHCM initiates a start to low load combustion.</p>
<h2>Shutdown</h2>
<p>To stop the Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH), the FFBHCM de-energizes the FFBH fuel pump to stop combustion, but continues operation of the combustion air fan and the coolant pump for a time, to cool down the FFBH. The cool down time is approximately 90 (diesel vehicles) or 120 (petrol vehicles) seconds.</p>
<h2>Diagnostics</h2>
<p>The FFBHCM monitors the Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH) system for faults. Any faults detected are stored in a volatile memory in the FFBHCM, which can be interrogated by Jaguar approved diagnostic equipment via the High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) comfort systems bus. A maximum of three faults and associated freeze frame data can be stored at any one time. If a further fault is detected, the oldest fault is overwritten by the new fault.</p>
<p>The FFBHCM also incorporates an error lockout mode of operation that inhibits operation to prevent serious faults from causing further damage to the system. In the error lockout mode, the FFBHCM immediately stops the FFBH fuel pump, and stops the combustion air fan and coolant pump after the cool down time. Error lockout occurs for start sequence failures, combustion flameouts, heat exchanger casing overheat and if battery voltage is out of limits.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Start failure and flameout: If a start sequence fails to establish combustion, or a flame-out occurs after combustion is established, the FFBHCM immediately initiates another start sequence. The start failure or flameout is also recorded by an event timer in the FFBHCM. The event timer is increased by one after each start failure or flameout, and decreased by one if a subsequent start is successful. If the event timer increases to three (over any number of drive cycles), the FFBHCM enters the error lockout mode.</li>
<li>Heat exchanger casing overheat: To protect the system from excessive temperatures, the FFBHCM enters the error lockout mode if the heat exchanger coolant temperature exceeds 125 &deg;C (257 &deg;F).</li>
<li>Battery voltage out of limits: Error lockout will occur if battery voltage is outside the limits of 10.5 Volts to 16.0 Volts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The error lockout mode can be cleared using Jaguar approved diagnostic equipment, or by disconnecting the battery power supply to the FFBH for a minimum of 10 seconds.</p>

<h2>Timed Climate Control</h2>
<p>If equipped, the timed climate control provides a comfortable temperature in the passenger compartment of a vehicle parked with the engine off. When timed climate control operates, the passenger compartment is either heated by the Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH) and climate control blower (parked heating) or cooled by the climate control blower (parked ventilation), depending on the ambient air temperature. Parked heating occurs if the ambient air temperature is less than 16 &deg;C (61 &deg;F). Parked ventilation occurs if the ambient air temperature is 16 &deg;C (61 &deg;F) or more. To prevent excessive drain on the battery, both parked heating and parked ventilation are automatically de-activated after 30 minutes.</p>
<p>In very cold conditions timed climate control also warms the engine to aid starting. Engine warming occurs if the ambient air temperature is -20 &deg;C (-4 &deg;F) or below.</p>
<p>When timed climate control is operating, the Light Emitting Diode (LED) in the AUTO or A/C switch on the Integrated Control Panel (ICP) will flash. If the AUTO switch LED flashes the engine or passenger compartment are being heated. If the A/C switch LED flashes the passenger compartment is being ventilated.</p>
<p>Timed climate control is controlled using either the Touch Screen (TS) or the FFBH remote control.</p>
<p>In order to minimize the potential for odor ingress from the FFBH, the HVAC Control Module will automatically close the recirculation door in the climate control assembly for the first 7 minutes of FFBH operation when activated by the timed climate control feature.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Touch Screen (TS)</p>
<p>The Touch Screen (TS) is used for direct selection of timed climate control or to program one or two 'on/off' cycle start-times per day, and one 'on/off' cycle start-time further in the future. The programmed start times are stored in the BCM/GWM assembly. The direct selection and programmed time modes of operation are selected when the engine is stopped and the smart key is in the vehicle. The key can then be removed and the vehicle locked. Any timed event will automatically run without the key inside the vehicle.</p>
</div>
<p>At a programmed start time or a direct selection on the TS, the BCM/GWM assembly sends a start signal to the HVAC via the High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) comfort systems bus. The HVAC then initiates the appropriate mode of timed climate control operation.</p>
<p>To set a timed climate program:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the HOME MENU switch.</li>
<li>Touch the Timed climate soft key. This soft key may be set on a personal shortcut or accessed via the Extra Features soft key. Select 7 day timer, or single event, and then select the timer soft key. If 7 day timer selected, then select the day for which you want to set a program. Alternatively, select All week to select the same start time for every day.</li>
<li>Touch the Timer 1 or Timer 2 soft key. The timers can be toggled between on and off using the power soft key.</li>
<li>Touch the up or down arrows to set the start time. Hours and minutes are adjusted separately.</li>
<li>Touch OK. The screen will display the activation time. If required, set the time for the other timer using the same process.</li>
<li>Once set, the timer events can be turned on or off as required in the Timed climate screen by selecting the 7 day timer or the single event soft key.</li>
</ol>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTES:</div>

<li>
<p>Timed climate control will only operate once between engine starts. For example, a timed climate control request from the FFBH remote control will not be performed if a programmed timed climate control event has already occurred.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Any programmed timed climate control cycle may be cancelled by touching the relevant power soft key on the timer set up menu or the 'Power' soft key on the 'Timed climate' information home menu.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Remote Control</p>
<p>When timed climate control is selected on or off with the Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH) remote control, the request is received by the FFBH receiver via the right TV antenna and the TV antenna amplifier. The FFBH receiver relays the request as a hardwired signal to the FFBHCM. On receipt of the request, the FFBHCM sends the request to the HVAC Control Module on the Local Interconnect Network (LIN) bus. The HVAC then initiates the appropriate mode of timed climate control operation.</p>
</div>
<p>A 'handshake' signal is sent back from the FFBH receiver to the remote control to confirm a valid on or off request and activate the remote control Light Emitting Diode (LED) accordingly.</p>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTE:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<p>The &lsquo;handshake&rsquo; signal only confirms remote control-FFBH receiver communications were successful, and not that the request has been performed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Timed Climate Control Operation</p>
<p>When the HVAC receives a timed climate control start request, its response depends on the ambient air temperature:</p>
</div>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>If the ambient temperature is 16 &deg;C (61 &deg;F) or more, the HVAC initiates parked ventilation and:<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li class="dash-subitem">Operates the blower at 47 % of maximum speed</li>
<li class="dash-subitem">Operates the distribution doors in the heater assembly to direct the air to the face level outlets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the ambient temperature is less than 16 &deg;C (61 &deg;F) and more than -20 &deg;C (-4 &deg;F), the HVAC initiates parked heating and:<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li class="dash-subitem">Energizes the changeover valve</li>
<li class="dash-subitem">Sends a LIN bus message to activate the FFBH</li>
<li class="dash-subitem">Operates the blower at 47% of the maximum speed</li>
<li class="dash-subitem">Operates the distribution doors in the heater assembly to direct the air to the footwells for approximately 30 seconds. After 30 seconds, depending on the ambient air temperature the air is directed to either only the windshield, or to both the footwells and the windshield.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the ambient temperature is -20 &deg;C (-4 &deg;F) or below, the HVAC sends a LIN bus message to activate the Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH), but leaves the changeover valve de-energized and does not operate the blower or distribution doors. Heated coolant is circulated around the engine and heater core to heat the engine and improve engine starting. Once the FFBH coolant temperature is above a suitable threshold the blower is switched on and passenger compartment heating commenced.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH) will only activate in timed climate control if the following threshold conditions are met:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Pre-burn battery voltage check: The voltage at the FFBH terminals is above 11.5 V.</li>
<li>Pre-burn coolant temperature check: The coolant temperature within the FFBH is less than 15 &deg;C (59 &deg;F)</li>
<li>Pre-burn fuel level check: The fuel level value, stored in the FFBH at ignition off, above 7.5 liters (1.98 US gal).</li>
</ul>
<p>The fuel level value stored within the FFBH is only updated when the engine is running. When starting the FFBH in timed climate control with the engine off, the fuel level value used in the FFBH calculations will be that stored at the ignition off event. It is therefore possible for the FFBH to fail to operate in timed climate control if the engine was stopped with a low fuel level. If the fuel tank is subsequently refueled, the FFBH stored fuel level will still read low if the engine has not been started since refueling.</p>
<p>After 30 minutes, or if timed climate control is selected off with the TS or FFBH remote control, the HVAC discontinues timed climate control operation.</p>
<p>If parked ventilation is active, the HVAC:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Switches off the blower</li>
<li> Returns the distribution doors to the previous settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>If parked heating is active, the HVAC:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Sends a LIN bus message to de-activate the FFBH.</li>
<li>Switches off the blower.</li>
<li>Returns the distribution doors to the previous settings.</li>
<li>After 3 minutes, de-energizes the changeover valve.</li>
</ul>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Transition from Timed Climate Control to Engine Running</p>
<p>Parked ventilation is automatically de-activated when the ignition is switched on.</p>
</div>
<p>If the engine coolant temperature is equal to or more than the heater coolant temperature the parked heating is de-activated when the engine starts.</p>
<p>If the engine coolant temperature is less than the heater coolant temperature, the parked heating remains active until the engine coolant temperature reaches the heater coolant temperature. The changeover valve also remains closed until the engine coolant temperature reaches the heater coolant temperature.</p>
