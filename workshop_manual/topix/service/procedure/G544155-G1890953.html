<p>Highly flammable, explosive &ndash; observe No Smoking policy.</p>
<p>Used as a part of the Supplemental Restraint System (SRS), mounted in various positions around the vehicle.</p>
<p>The inflator contains a high-energetic propellant which, when ignited, produces a VERY HOT GAS (2500&deg; C).</p>
<p>The gas generant used in air bags is Sodium Azide. This material is hermetically sealed in the module and is completely consumed during deployment. No attempt should be made to open an air bag inflator as this will lead to the risk of exposure to Sodium Azide. If a gas generator is ruptured, full protective clothing should be worn when dealing with the spillage.</p>
<p>After normal deployment, gloves and safety goggles should be worn during the handling process.</p>
<p>Deployed air bags should be disposed of in a plastic bag in accordance with local regulations at an approved chemical waste site.</p>

<p>Chemical materials such as solvents, sealers, adhesives, paints, resin foams, battery acids, antifreeze, brake fluids, fuels, oils and grease should always be used with caution and stored and handled with care. They may be toxic, harmful, corrosive, irritant or highly flammable and give rise to hazardous fumes and dusts.</p>
<p>The effects of excessive exposure to chemicals may be immediate or delayed; briefly experienced or permanent; cumulative; superficial; life threatening; or may reduce life-expectancy.</p>
<p>Chemical Materials - Do's</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Do carefully read and observe hazard and precaution warnings given on material containers (labels) and in any accompanying leaflets, posters or other instructions. Material health and safety data sheets can be obtained from manufacturers</li>
<li>Do remove chemical materials from the skin and clothing as soon as practical after soiling. Change heavily soiled clothing and have it cleaned</li>
<li>Do organise work practices and protective clothing to avoid soiling of the skin and eyes, and the breathing in of vapors, aerosols, dusts or fumes</li>
<li>Do wash before breaks, before eating, smoking, drinking or using toilet facilities when handling chemical materials</li>
<li>Do keep work areas clean, uncluttered and free from spills</li>
<li>Do store chemical materials according to national and local regulations</li>
<li>Do keep chemical materials out of the reach of children</li>
</ul>
<p>Chemical Materials - Do Nots</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Do not mix chemical materials except under the manufacturer's instructions; some chemicals can form other toxic or harmful chemicals, give off toxic or harmful fumes or become explosive when mixed together</li>
<li>Do not spray chemical materials, particularly those based on solvents, in confined spaces e.g. when people are inside a vehicle</li>
<li>Do not apply heat or flame to chemical materials except under the manufacturer's instructions. Some are highly flammable and some may release toxic or harmful fumes</li>
<li>Do not leave containers open. Fumes given off can build up to toxic, harmful or explosive concentrations. Some fumes are heavier than air and will accumulate in confined areas, pits etc.</li>
<li>Do not transfer chemical materials to unlabeled containers</li>
<li>Do not clean hands or clothing with chemicals. Chemicals, particularly solvents and fuels, will dry skin and may cause irritation leading to dermatitis or be absorbed through the skin in toxic or harmful quantities</li>
<li>Do not use emptied containers for other materials except when they have been cleaned under supervised conditions</li>
<li>Do not sniff or smell chemical materials. Brief exposure to high concentrations of fumes can be toxic or harmful</li>
</ul>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC)</div>
</div>
<p>There is concern in the scientific community that CFCs and Halons are depleting the upper ozone layer which filters out harmful ultraviolet radiation. Decreased filtration of ultraviolet radiation may result in increases in skin cancer, cataracts and immune system suppression in humans, as well as decreased productivity of crops and aquatic systems.</p>
<p>CFCs are used primarily as refrigerants in vehicle air conditioning systems and as aerosol propellants. Halons are used as fire extinguishants.</p>
<p>Jaguar supports worldwide elimination of CFC usage and it is recommended that Company subsidiaries and affiliates should phase out CFC usage as soon as acceptable substitutes are commercially available.</p>

<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">Gasoline (Petrol)</div>
</div>
<p>Highly flammable - observe No Smoking policy.</p>
<p>Swallowing can result in mouth and throat irritation and absorption from the stomach can result in drowsiness and unconsciousness. Small amounts can be fatal to children. Aspiration of liquid into the lungs e.g. through vomiting, is a very serious hazard.</p>
<p>Gasoline dries the skin and can cause irritation and dermatitis on prolonged or repeated contact. Liquid in the eye causes severe pain.</p>
<p>Motor gasoline may contain appreciable quantities of benzene, which is toxic upon inhalation, and the concentration of gasoline vapors must be kept very low. High concentrations will cause eye, nose and throat irritation, nausea, headache, depression and symptoms of drunkenness. Very high concentrations will result in rapid loss of consciousness.</p>
<p>Ensure there is adequate ventilation when handling and using gasoline. Great care must be taken to avoid the serious consequences of inhalation in the event of vapor build up arising from spillages in confined spaces.</p>
<p>Special precautions apply to cleaning and maintenance operations on gasoline storage tanks.</p>
<p>Gasoline should not be used as a cleaning agent. It must not be siphoned by mouth. See First Aid.</p>

<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">Kerosene (Paraffin)</div>
</div>
<p>Used also as heating fuel, solvent and cleaning agent.</p>
<p>Flammable - observe No Smoking policy.</p>
<p>Irritation of the mouth and throat may result from swallowing. The main hazard from swallowing arises if liquid aspiration into the lungs occurs.</p>
<p>Liquid contact dries the skin and can cause irritation or dermatitis. Splashes in the eye may be slightly irritating.</p>
<p>In normal circumstances the low volatility does not give rise to harmful vapors. Exposure to mists and vapors from kerosene at elevated temperature should be avoided (mists may arise in dewaxing). Avoid skin and eye contact and make sure there is adequate ventilation.</p>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">Gas Cylinders</div>
</div>
<p>See also Fire.</p>
<p>Gases such as oxygen, acetylene, argon and propane are normally stored in cylinders at pressures of up to 13.790 kPa, (2000 lb/in&sup2;) and great care should be taken in handling these cylinders to avoid mechanical damage to them or to the valve gear attached. The contents of each cylinder should be clearly identified by appropriate markings.</p>
<p>Cylinders should be stored in well ventilated enclosures, and protected from ice and snow, or direct sunlight. Fuel gases (e.g. acetylene and propane) should not be stored in close proximity to oxygen cylinders.</p>
<p>Care should be exercised to prevent leaks from gas cylinders and lines, and to avoid sources of ignition.</p>
<p>Only trained personnel should undertake work involving gas cylinders.</p>

<div class="grey-heading">Legal Aspects</div>
</div>
<p>Many laws and regulations make requirements relating to health and safety in the use and disposal of materials and equipment in workshops. Some of these laws which apply in the UK are listed. Similar laws exist for other territories:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The Factories Act (1961)</li>
<li>The Asbestos Regulations (1969)</li>
<li>Highly Flammable Liquids and Liquified Petroleum Gases Regulations (1972)</li>
<li>Control of Pollution Act (1974)</li>
<li>Health and Safety at Work Act (1974)</li>
<li>The Classification, Packaging and Labelling of Dangerous Substances Regulations (1978, 1981, 1983, 1984)</li>
<li>Control of Lead at Work Regulations (1980)</li>
<li>Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations (1989)</li>
<li>Abrasive Wheels Regulations (1970)</li>
<li>Reporting of injuries, diseases and dangerous occurrences regulations 1985 (RIDDOR)</li>
</ul>
<p>Workshops should be familiar, in detail, with these and associated laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Consult the local factory inspectorate if in any doubt.</p>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">Lubricants and Greases</div>
</div>
<p>Avoid all prolonged and repeated contact with mineral oils. All lubricants and greases may be irritating to the eyes and skin.</p>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">Used Engine Oil</div>
</div>
<p>Prolonged and repeated contact with mineral oil will result in the removal of natural oils from the skin, leading to dryness, irritation and dermatitis. In addition, used engine oil contains potentially harmful contaminants which may cause skin cancer. Adequate means of skin protection and washing facilities must be provided.</p>
<p>Do not employ used engine oils as lubricants or for any application where appreciable skin contact is likely to occur.</p>
<p>There are publications describing the problems and advising on precautionary measures. For the UK a typical Health and Safety Executive publication is: SHW 397: Cautionary Notice: Effects of mineral oil on the skin.</p>
<p>Health Protection Precautions</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Avoid prolonged and repeated contact with oils, particularly used engine oils</li>
<li>Wear protective clothing, including impervious gloves where practicable</li>
<li>Do not put oily rags into pockets</li>
<li>Avoid contaminating clothing with oil</li>
<li>Heavily soiled clothing and oil-impregnated footwear should not be worn. Overalls must be cleaned regularly</li>
<li>First Aid treatment should be obtained immediately for open cuts and wounds.</li>
<li>Use barrier creams, applying them before each work period, to enable easier removal of dirty oil and grease from the skin</li>
<li>Wash with soap and water to make sure all oil is removed (skin cleansers and nail brushes will help). Preparations containing lanolin replace the natural skin oils which have been removed</li>
<li>Do not use gasoline (petrol), kerosene (paraffin), diesel fuel (gas oil), thinners or solvents for cleaning skin.</li>
<li>If skin disorders develop, obtain medical advice without delay</li>
<li>Where practical, degrease components prior to handling</li>
<li>Where there is a risk of eye contact, eye protection should be worn, for example, goggles or face shields; in addition an eye wash facility should be provided</li>
</ul>
<p>Environmental Precautions</p>
<p>Burning used engine oil in small space heaters or boilers can be recommended only for units of approved design. In the UK the heating system must meet the requirements of HM Inspectorate of Pollution for small burners of less than 0.4 MW. If in doubt check with the appropriate local authority and/or manufacturer of approved appliances.</p>
<p>Dispose of used oil and used oil filters through authorized waste disposal contractors or licensed waste disposal sites, or to the waste oil reclamation trade, batteries should also be disposed off under similar arrangements. If in doubt, contact the relevant local authority for advice on disposal facilities.</p>
<p>It is illegal to pour used oil, antifreeze and automatic transmission fluid on to the ground, down sewers, drains, or into water courses.</p>

<div class="grey-heading">Solder</div>
</div>
<p>Solders are a mixture of metals such that the melting point of the mixture is below that of the constituent metals (normally lead and tin). Solder application does not normally give rise to toxic lead fumes, provided a gas/air flame is used. Oxy-acetylene flames should not be used, as they are much hotter and will cause lead fumes to be produced.</p>
<p>Some fumes may be produced by the application of any flame to surfaces coated with grease etc. and inhalation of these should be avoided.</p>
<p>Removal of excess solder should be undertaken with care, to make sure that fine lead dust is not produced, which can give toxic effects if inhaled. Respiratory protection may be necessary.</p>
<p>Solder spillage and filings should be collected and removed promptly to prevent general air contamination by lead.</p>
<p>High standards of personal hygiene are necessary in order to avoid ingestion of lead or inhalation of solder dust from clothing.</p>

<p>Used in cleaning and de-waxing materials, paints, plastics, resins, thinners etc.</p>
<p>Some may be highly flammable or flammable.</p>
<p>Skin contact will degrease the skin and may result in irritation and dermatitis following repeated or prolonged contact. Some can be absorbed through the skin in toxic or harmful quantities.</p>
<p>Splashes in the eye may cause severe irritation and could lead to loss of vision.</p>
<p>Brief exposure to high concentrations of vapors or mists will cause eye and throat irritation, drowsiness, dizziness, headaches and, in the worst circumstances, unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to excessive but lower concentrations of vapors or mists, for which there might not be adequate warning indications, can cause more serious toxic or harmful effects.</p>
<p>Aspiration into the lungs (e.g. through vomiting) is the most serious consequence of swallowing.</p>
<p>Avoid splashes to the skin, eyes and clothing. Wear protective gloves, goggles and clothing if necessary.</p>
<p>Ensure good ventilation when in use, avoid breathing fumes, vapors and spray mists and keep containers tightly sealed. Do not use in confined spaces.</p>
<p>When spraying materials containing solvents, e.g. paints, adhesive, coatings, use extraction ventilation or personal respiratory protection in the absence of adequate general ventilation.</p>
<p>Do not apply heat or flame except under specific and detailed manufacturer's instructions.</p>

<div class="grey-heading">Viton</div>
</div>
<p>In common with many other manufacturers' vehicles, some components installed to the Jaguar range have 'O' rings, seals or gaskets which contain a material known as 'Viton'.</p>
<p>Viton is a fluoroelastomer, that is a synthetic rubber type which contains Fluorine. It is commonly used for 'O' rings, gaskets and seals of all types. Although Viton is the most well known fluoroelastomer, there are others, including Fluorel and Tecmoflon.</p>
<p>When used under design conditions fluoroelastomers are perfectly safe. If, however, they are exposed to temperatures in excess of 400&ordm; C, the material will not burn, but will decompose, and one of the products formed is hydrofluoric acid.</p>
<p>This acid is extremely corrosive and may be absorbed directly, through contact, into the body.</p>
<p>'O' rings, seals or gaskets which have been exposed to very high temperatures will appear charred or as a black sticky substance.</p>
<p>DO NOT, under any circumstances touch them or the attached components.</p>
<p>Enquiries should be made to determine whether Viton or any other fluoroelastomer has been used in the affected 'O' ring, seal or gasket. If they are of natural rubber or nitrile there is no hazard. If in doubt, be cautious and assume that the material may be Viton or any fluoroelastomer.</p>
<p>If Viton or any other fluoroelastomers have been used, the affected area should be decontaminated before the commencement of work.</p>
<p>Disposable heavy duty plastic gloves should be worn at all times, and the affected area washed down using wire wool and a limewater (calcium hydroxide) solution to neutralize the acid before disposing of the decomposed Viton residue and final cleaning of the area. After use, the plastic gloves should be discarded carefully and safely.</p>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">Welding</div>
</div>
<p>See also Fire, Electric Shock, Gas Cylinders.</p>
<p>Welding processes include Resistance Welding (Spot Welding), Arc Welding and Metal Active Gas (MAG) Welding for Steel vehicles, Metal Inert Gas (MIG) for Aluminum vehicles.</p>
<p>Resistance Welding (Spot Welding)</p>
<p>This process may cause particles of molten metal to be emitted at a high velocity, and the eyes and skin must be protected.</p>
<p>Arc Welding</p>
<p>This process emits a high level of ultraviolet radiation which may cause arc-eye and skin burns to the operator and to other persons nearby. Gas-shielded welding processes are particularly hazardous in this respect. Personal protection must be worn, and screens used to shield other people.</p>
<p>CONTACT LENS WEARERS ARE ADVISED TO REVERT TO ORDINARY SPECTACLES WHEN ARC WELDING as the arc spectrum is believed to emit microwaves which dry out the fluid between the lens and the eye. This may result in blindness when the lens is removed from the eye.</p>
<p>Metal spatter will also occur, and appropriate eye and skin protection is necessary.</p>
<p>The heat of the welding arc will produce fumes and gases from the metals being welded, the rods and from any applied coatings or contamination on the surfaces being worked on. These gases and fumes may be toxic and inhalation of these should be avoided. The use of extraction ventilation to remove the fumes from the working area may be necessary particularly in cases where the general ventilation is poor, or where considerable welding work is anticipated. In extreme cases or confined spaces where adequate ventilation cannot be provided, air-fed respirators may be necessary.</p>
<p>SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS MUST BE TAKEN BEFORE ANY WELDING OR CUTTING TAKES PLACE ON VESSELS WHICH HAVE CONTAINED COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS, E.G. BOILING OR STEAMING OUT OF FUEL TANKS.</p>

<ul class="wcn-list">
<li>
<p>Working on the fuel system results in fuel and fuel vapor being present in the atmosphere. Fuel vapor is extremely flammable, hence great care must be taken whilst working on the fuel system. Adhere strictly to the following precautions:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" class="wcn">
<li>Do not smoke in the work area</li>
<li>Display 'no smoking' signs around the area</li>
<li>Disconnect the battery before working on the fuel system</li>
<li>Do not connect/disconnect electrical circuits, use electrical equipment or other tools or engage in working practices which in any way may result in the production of sparks</li>
<li>Ensure that a CO&sup2; fire extinguisher is close at hand</li>
<li>Ensure that dry sand is available to soak up any fuel spillage</li>
<li>Empty fuel using suitable fire proof equipment into an authorized explosion proof container</li>
<li>Do not empty fuel while working in a workshop or a pit</li>
<li>Ensure that working area is well ventilated</li>
<li>Ensure that any work on the fuel system is only carried out by experienced and well qualified maintenance personnel</li>
<li>Ensure that fume extraction equipment is used where appropriate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fume extraction equipment must be in operation when solvents are used e.g. Trichloroethane, white spirit, sbp3, methylene chloride, perchlorethylene. Do not smoke in the vicinity of volatile degreasing agents.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Whenever possible, use a ramp or pit whilst working beneath a vehicle, in preference to jacking. Position chocks at the wheels as well as applying the parking brake. Never rely on a jack alone to support a vehicle. Use axle stands, or blocks carefully placed at the jacking points, to provide a rigid location. Check that any lifting equipment used has adequate capacity and is fully serviceable. Ensure that a suitable form of fire extinguisher is conveniently located. When using electrical tools and equipment, inspect the power lead for damage and check that it is properly earthed. Disconnect the earth (grounded) terminal of the vehicle battery. Do not disconnect any pipes of the air conditioning refrigeration system unless you are trained and instructed to do so. A refrigerant is used which can cause blindness if allowed to come into contact with the eyes. Ensure that adequate ventilation is provided when volatile degreasing agents are being used.</p>
<p>Adhere strictly to handling and safety instructions given on containers and labels. Keep oils and solvents away from naked flames and other sources of ignition. Do not apply heat in an attempt to free seized nuts or fittings; as well as causing damage to protective coatings, there is a risk of damage from stray heat to electronic equipment and brake lines. Do not leave tools, equipment, spilt oil etc. around the work area. Wear protective overalls and use barrier cream when necessary.</p>
