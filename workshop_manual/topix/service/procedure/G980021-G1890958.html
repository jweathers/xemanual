</div>
<p>Always install covers to protect the fenders before commencing work in the engine compartment. Always install the interior protection kit, wear clean overalls and wash hands or wear gloves before working inside the vehicle. Avoid spilling hydraulic fluid, antifreeze or battery acid on the paintwork. In the event of spillage, wash off with water immediately. Use polythene sheets in the luggage compartment to protect carpets. Always use the recommended service tool, or a satisfactory equivalent, where specified. Protect temporarily exposed screw threads by replacing nuts or installing caps.</p>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">Vehicle in Workshop</div>
</div>
<p>When working on a vehicle in the workshop always make sure that:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The parking brake is applied or the wheels are securely chocked to prevent the vehicle moving forwards or backwards</li>
<li>If the engine is to be run, there is adequate ventilation, or an extraction hose to remove exhaust fumes is installed</li>
<li>There is adequate room to jack up the vehicle and remove the wheels, if necessary</li>
<li>Fender covers are always installed if any work is to be carried out in the engine compartment</li>
<li>The battery is disconnected if working on the engine, underneath the vehicle, or if the vehicle is jacked up</li>
</ul>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="caution-alert">CAUTION:</div>

<li>Unless stated otherwise, self-locking nuts once removed must be discarded and new nuts of the same type strength grade installed.</li>
<li>Damaged nuts, bolts and screws must always be discarded. Attempting to recut or repair damaged threads with a tap or die impairs the strength and fit of the threads and is not recommended.</li>
</ul>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTES:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<ul class="wcn-list">
<li>
<p> During certain repair operations, it may be necessary to remove traces of thread locking agents using a tap. Where this is necessary, the instruction to do so will appear in the relevant operation and it is essential that a tap of the correct size and thread is used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New Taptite bolts when used cut their own threads on the first application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Some bolts are coated with a thread locking agent and unless stated otherwise, they must not be reused. New bolts having the same part number as the original must always be installed. When nuts or bolts are to be discarded, the repair operation and relevant torque chart will include an instruction to that effect. Do not use proprietary thread locking agents as they may not meet the specification required. See also Encapsulated ('Patched') Bolts and Screws.</li>
<li>Always make sure that replacement nuts and bolts are at least equal in strength to those that they are replacing. Castellated nuts must not be loosened to accept a split pin except in recommended cases when this forms part of an adjustment.</li>
<li>Do not allow oil or grease to enter blind holes, the hydraulic action resulting from tightening the bolt or stud can split the housing and also give a false torque reading.</li>
<li>Always tighten a nut, bolt or screw to the specified torque figure, damaged or corroded threads can give a false torque reading.</li>
<li>Nut and bolt loosening and tightening sequences, where given, must ALWAYS be followed. Distortion of components or faulty sealing of joints will result if the sequences are not followed. Where an instruction is given to tighten in stages, these stages must be adhered to; do not attempt to combine stages particularly where certain stages involve tightening by degrees.</li>
<li>To check or re-tighten a fixing to a specified torque, first loosen a quarter of a turn, then re-tighten to the specified torque figure.</li>
<li>Unless instructed otherwise, do not lubricate bolt or nut threads prior to installing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where it is stated that bolts and screws may be reused, the following procedures must be carried out: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Check that threads are undamaged.</li>
<li>Remove all traces of locking agent from the threads.</li>
</ul>
<div class="wcn-container">

<li>Never drop an SRS component. The airbag diagnostic control unit is a particularly shock sensitive device and must be handled with extreme care. Airbag modules and seat belt pre-tensioners could deploy if subjected to a strong shock.</li>
<li>Never wrap your arms around an airbag module. If a module has to be carried, hold it by the cover with the cover uppermost and the base away from your body.</li>
<li>Never transport airbag modules or seat belt pre-tensioner in the passenger compartment of a vehicle. Always use the luggage compartment of the vehicle for carrying airbag modules and seat belt pre-tensioner units.</li>
<li> Never attach anything to an airbag cover or any trim component covering an airbag module. Do not allow anything to rest on top of an airbag module.</li>
<li>Always keep components cool, dry and free from contamination.</li>
<li>Never apply grease or cleaning solvents to seat belt pre-tensioner units, component failure could result.</li>
<li>Always store an airbag module with the deployment side uppermost. If it is stored deployment side down, accidental deployment will propel the airbag module with sufficient force to cause serious injury.</li>

<p>Deployment procedures and precautions as detailed in this manual should be strictly adhered to. Only personnel who have undergone the appropriate training should undertake deployment of airbag and pre-tensioner modules. The following precautions must be complied with:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Only use deployment equipment approved for the intended purpose.</li>
<li>Deployment of airbag / pre-tensioner modules must be performed in a well ventilated area which has been designated for the purpose.</li>

<li>Where local legislation exists, notify the relevant authorities of intention to deploy airbag and pretensioner units.</li>
<li>When deploying airbag pre-tensioner units, make sure that all personnel are at least 15 metres (45 feet) away from the deployment zone.</li>
<li>Make sure deployment tool is connected correctly, in compliance with the instructions detailed in the SRS section of this manual. In particular, make sure deployment tool is NOT connected to battery supply before connecting to airbag module connector.</li>
<li>When deploying seat belt pre-tensioners, make sure pre-tensioner unit is secured correctly to the seat.</li>
<li>When removing deployed airbag modules and pre-tensioner units, wear protective clothing. Use gloves and seal deployed units in a plastic bag.</li>
<li>Following deployment of any component of the SRS system within the vehicle, all SRS components must be replaced. DO NOT reuse or salvage any parts of the SRS system.</li>
<li>Do not lean over an airbag module when connecting deployment equipment.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a vehicle is to be scrapped, undeployed airbag modules and pre-tensioner units must be manually deployed. In this case airbags can be deployed in the vehicle. Before deployment, make sure the airbag module is secure within its correct mounting position. Deployment of the driver's airbag in the vehicle may damage the steering wheel; if the vehicle is not being scrapped, deploy the module outside of the vehicle.</p>

<p>The Restraints Control Module (RCM) will log a crash fault after every impact which is severe enough to cause airbag deployment. <span class="bold-black">It is possible to have three crashes/impacts logged after one event where, for example, a front, side and rollover has occurred. After the third fault is logged, the SRS warning lamp will be illuminated and the RCM must be installed. After any airbag deployment a new RCM must be installed. </span>

<p>The SRS side impact sensor must be replaced if there are any signs of physical damage or if the restraints control module (RCM) is registering a fault.</p>
