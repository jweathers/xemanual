<div class="grey-heading">OVERVIEW</div>
</div>
<h2>Parking Aid System</h2>
<p>The parking aid system provides an audible warning to the driver when any obstacles are in the path of the vehicle during forward or reverse parking manoeuver.</p>
<p>The system comprises off:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Parking Aid Control Module (PACM).</li>
<li>Parking aid switch.</li>
<li>Four ultrasonic sensors in the front bumper.</li>
<li>Four ultrasonic sensors in the rear bumper.</li>
</ul>
<p>During low speeds, the PACM uses the ultrasonic sensors to monitor the area around the front and rear bumpers. If an object is detected within a monitored area, the PACM then outputs a warning signal using the audio system speakers. The sensors can detect solid objects such as posts, walls and other vehicles. Objects very close to the ground may not be detected, but because of their low height may not cause damage to the vehicle.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">360&ordm; Parking Aid System</p>
<p>360&ordm; Parking aid system is an additional feature to the parking aid system. The system uses the front and rear park assist sensors as well as the parking aid sensors.</p>
</div>
<p>When the vehicle is moving the parking aid and park assist sensors are scanning the vehicle surroundings. When a given obstacle is detected and then moves out the sensor's range, it will then be tracked. Information will then be displayed via the Touch Screen (TS) informing the driver of close, mid and far range objects and the relevant area in which these objects have been detected.</p>
<p>The PACM still outputs a warning signal using the audio system speakers.</p>
<h2>Park Assist System</h2>
<p>The park assist system allows the vehicle to manoeuver into and out of a parking space.</p>
<p>There are three available features to park assist:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parallel parking.</li>
<li>Perpendicular parking.</li>
<li>Parking exit.</li>
</ol>
<p>The system comprises off:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Parking Aid Control Module (PACM).</li>
<li>Park assist switch.</li>
<li>Two ultrasonic sensors on the wheel arch outer front finishers.</li>
<li>Two ultrasonic sensors on the wheel arch outer rear finishers.</li>
<li>Also uses the front and rear parking aid sensors.</li>
</ul>
<p>When one of the features of park assist is selected, instructions are displayed in the message center. These instructions are communicated to the driver using the following methods:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Visual - graphical and text message instructions.</li>
<li>Audible - variable sound tones.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a system fault is detected, a continuous tone will sound and a fault message is displayed in the message center.</p>
<h2>Rear View Camera (RVC) and Proximity Camera Systems</h2>
<p>Depending on vehicle specification, either a Rear View Camera (RVC) or Proximity Camera system will be equipped. These systems provide additional information to the driver when reversing or maneuvering.</p>
<p>The RVC system will only use one camera in the tailgate and is only operational when Reverse (R) gear selected. This will display a wide-angle image of the rear of the vehicle.</p>
<p>The Proximity Camera system will use four cameras, one in the front bumper, one in the tailgate and a camera in each of the door mirrors. They will become operational when Reverse (R) gear, Drive (D) gear or camera switch is selected on the TS or camera switch on the left TS switchpack. This will display a wide-angle image of the front, rear and sides of the vehicle.</p>

</div>
<p>The Parking Aid Control Module (PACM) located behind the Instrument Panel (IP).</p>
<p>The PACM has two connectors which provide power, ground, High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) chassis systems bus connections, front and rear parking aid sensors and front and rear park assist sensors.</p>
<p>The HS CAN chassis system bus connections provide for the receipt of the following information from the systems:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) control module - Road speed signal.</li>
<li>Transmission Control Module (TCM) - Reverse (R) and Drive (D) gear engaged signal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The PACM also outputs messages on the HS CAN chassis systems bus.</p>
<p>The Body Control Module/Gateway Module (BCM/GWM) assembly processes these messages and passes them to HS CAN comfort systems bus</p>
<p>If the vehicle is equipped with the following system, the HS CAN comfort systems bus messages are sent the Audio Head Unit (AHU):</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>InControl&trade; Touch infotainment system.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the vehicle is equipped with the following system, the HS CAN comfort systems bus messages are sent the Infotainment Master Controller (IMC):</p>

<p>The Rear View Camera (RVC) is located in the tailgate. The RVC is a Video Graphics Array (VGA) resolution analogue camera that provides an image covering a zone approximately 130&deg; wide by 112&deg; deep and is capable of capturing approximately thirty frames per second. An electrical connector on the camera provides power, ground, High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) comfort systems bus and Composite Video Baseband Signal (CVBS) or Low-Voltage Differential signalling (LVDS) connections depending on infotainment specification.</p>
<p>If the vehicle is equipped with the following system, a CVBS connection is used for video image transmission between the camera and the Audio Head Unit (AHU):</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>InControl&trade; Touch infotainment system.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the vehicle is equipped with the following system, a Low-Voltage Differential signalling (LVDS) connection to the Camera Control Module (CCM):</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>In Control&trade; Touch Pro infotainment systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>The camera provides additional information to the driver when reversing the vehicle. When reverse gear is selected the camera automatically displays a wide-angle color image of the view from the rear of the vehicle on the TS.</p>
<p>The positioning accuracy of the camera is crucial for successful operation, therefore care must be taken when installing a cameras to ensure it sits correctly in the bracket. In the event of camera replacement, a calibration routine must be performed.</p>

<p>The connections to the CCM include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) comfort systems bus.</li>
<li>Four camera inputs.</li>
<li>Video signal.</li>
<li>Power and supply.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Camera Control Module (CCM) gathers the camera images and analyses and alters them by adjusting perspectives and applying corrections.</p>
<p>If the vehicle is equipped with the following system, the resulting processed images are then relayed to a Audio Head Unit (AHU) using a Composite Video Baseband Signal (CVBS) connection:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>InControl&trade; Touch infotainment system.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the vehicle is equipped with the following system, the resulting processed images are then relayed to a Infotainment Master Controller (IMC) using a Composite Video Baseband Signal (CVBS) connection:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>InControl&trade; Touch Pro infotainment system.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CCM also adds guidance and warning overlays to the camera images to create the various driving-aid features supported by the camera systems.</p>
<p>The CCM communicates with each individual camera using a Low-Voltage Differential Signal (LVDS). This data link transmits diagnostic information, for example camera serial numbers and fault notifications to the CCM. Camera adjustments, for instance a correction to color-balance are also communicated via LVDS link to the camera.</p>

<p>The proximity camera system has four cameras that are located in the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>One camera located in the front bumper.</li>
<li>One camera in each of the door mirrors.</li>
<li>One camera in the tailgate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The proximity camera system uses Video Graphics Array (VGA) resolution cameras that are permanently powered whenever the ignition is 'on'. Each camera provides an image covering a zone approximately 130&deg; wide by 112&deg; deep and is capable of capturing approximately thirty frames per second.</p>
<p>The cameras employ high-quality digital High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging, which is set of techniques that allow a greater range of luminance between light and dark areas of an image scene. This allows HDR to more accurately represent the varying intensity levels found in the image scenes that can range from direct sunlight to deep shadows.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Camera Mounting</p>
<p>To reduce the cost of accident repair, the mounting of the front bumper cameras feature a &lsquo;snap free&rsquo; bracket. On impact, the bracket will release the camera preventing damage to the camera itself. Depending on the severity of the accident it may also be possible to reuse the brackets as they are manufactured from a memory type plastic.</p>
</div>
<p>The positioning accuracy of all the cameras is crucial for the successful operation of the proximity camera system. The camera housings are manufactured using metal to maintain a structural stability in high-ambient temperatures. Without this stability a loss of image focus would be a possibility, therefore care must be taken when mounting the cameras in ensuring they sit correctly into their locations. Secure mounting of the cameras provides an initial &lsquo;build up&rsquo; tolerance accurate to 2 mm. In the event of camera replacement, a calibration routine must be performed.</p>

<div class="grey-heading">PARKING AID SYSTEM - OPERATION</div>
</div>
<p>The parking aid system is activated when:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Reverse (R) gear is selected directly form Park (P).</li>
<li>Drive (D) gear is subsequently selected, and the vehicle speed is less than 16 km/h (10 mph).</li>
<li>Drive (D) gear is selected directly from Park (P) and the Parking aid switch is operated. The sensors will remain active until the vehicle speed is less than 16 km/h (10 mph).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Audible Warnings</h2>
<p>The Parking Aid Control Module (PACM) processes the distance readings from the ultrasonic parking aid sensors to determine if there are any objects within the detection areas. If there are no objects no audible warning will be emitted. If an object is detected, repeated audible warnings are emitted via the audio system speakers. The time delay between the audible warnings decreases as the distance between the detected object and the vehicle decreases until eventually a continuous tone is emitted from the audio system speakers.</p>

<h2>Detection Calculation</h2>
<p>In the combined mode, the sensors emit a series of ultrasonic impulses and then switch to receiver mode to receive the echo reflected by an obstacle within the detection range. The received echo signals are amplified and converted from an analogue signal to a digital signal by the sensor. The digital signal is passed to the Parking Aid Control Module (PACM) and compared with pre-programmed data stored in an electrically erasable programmable read only memory within the PACM. The PACM receives this data via the signal line from the sensor and calculates the distance from the object using the elapsed time between the transmitted and received impulse. The duration of the impulse duration is determined by the module, with the sensor controlling the frequency of the impulse output.</p>
<p>When in Reverse (R) gear, both the front and rear sensors are active, when in a forward gear, only the front sensors are active.</p>
<p>In receiver mode, the sensor receives impulses that were emitted by adjacent sensors. The PACM uses this information to precisely determine the position and distance of the object.</p>
<p>If no objects are detected there are no further warning tones. If an object is detected, repeated audible tones are emitted from either the front or rear audio speakers as appropriate. The time delay between the tones decreases as the distance between the object and the vehicle decreases, until at approximately 300 mm (12 inches), the audible tone becomes continuous.</p>
<p>After the initial detection of an object, if there is no decrease in the distance between an object and the central sensors, the time delay between the audible warnings remains constant. If an object is detected by one of the corner sensors only, the audible warnings stop after approximately three seconds if there is no change in the distance between an object and the corner sensor.</p>
<p>When approaching several objects within detection range, the PACM recognizes the distance from the vehicle to the nearest object.</p>
<p>If it is in reverse gear only the object in the rear will be reported. If it is in drive only the object in the front will be reported. If two objects are detected at equal distance (one front one rear) the audible tones will alternate between the front and rear audio speakers.</p>
<p>If two objects are detected at equal distance (one front one rear) the audible tones will alternate between the front and rear audio speakers.</p>
<p>The volume output of the parking aid audible tones can be adjusted using the audio volume control when the parking aid system is activated. The volume can also be adjusted from the home menu screen by selecting 'Setup', 'System' followed by 'Volume Presets' on the Touch Screen (TS). The volume can be adjusted using the + or - selections on the TS.</p>
<p>The PACM receives a signal on the High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) chassis systems bus from the Body Control Module/Gateway Module (BCM/GWM) assembly, when a trailer is equipped. When this signal is detected, the PACM suspends operation of the rear parking aid system. The ignition needs to be cycled once the trailer has been disconnected to activate the rear parking aid system.</p>

<p>The 360&ordm; Parking aid system automatically becomes active when the parking aid system is turned on, except in park gear. The 360&ordm; Parking aid system is turned on via the parking aid switch or if Reverse (R) gear is selected.</p>
<p>The park assist sensors will monitor the vehicles surrounding area. When an object has been detected and then moves out of the sensor's range, it will then be tracked. The software which the Parking Aid Control Module (PACM) implements, takes into consideration the trajectory of the vehicle based on the vehicle speed and steering wheel angle.</p>
<p>If the vehicle is equipped with the following system, the PACM will then inform the driver via the Audio Head Unit (AHU), the information the PACM received from the parking aid and park assist sensors:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>InControl&trade; Touch Pro infotainment system.</li>
</ul>
<p>The PACM relays information to the AHU or IMC, using the High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) chassis systems bus. The AHU or IMC will then receive this using the HS CAN comfort bus.</p>
<p>The AHU or IMC will then inform the TS which will then display an on screen plan view of the vehicle with predefined zones and sectors around it. The location and distance of an obstacle is represented by bars.</p>
<p>The bars are color coded:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Red - close range and object in collision course. </li>
<li>Amber - mid range and object in collision course.</li>
<li>Yellow - far range and object in collision course.</li>
<li>Grey - any range and object not in collision course.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 360&ordm; parking aid system also provides a warning audio alert. On a threat of detection within the predefined range, audio beeps are reproduced. As the distance to threat diminishes the repetition frequency increases. At the minimum safe guard distance the beeps turn into constant tone.</p>

<li>Colored bars represent the amount of distance between the vehicle and the object being approached. Working in conjunction with the standard &lsquo;rear parking aid&rsquo; this adds a visual representation to the existing audible warning. The distance data is received from the CCM through the High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) comfort systems bus.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reversing-aid graphics can be disabled in the settings menu or by touching the TS whilst reverse gear is selected and the camera view is displayed.</p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">Special Views</span>
</p>
<p>The special views are a selection of pre-set views that provide the driver with some useful driving aids. These can be considered as a shortcut to some pre-determined images that have been developed to assist the driver in various situations:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Aerial view: downward view of the vehicle using all four cameras.</li>
<li>T-Junction view: outward view from the two front cameras.</li>
<li>Rear view: outward view from the rear camera.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">System Calibration</span>
</p>
<p>This level of accuracy must be maintained after any service procedures are performed on the vehicle that affects the proximity camera system. Should the control module or any one of the cameras require replacement, static re-calibration must be carried out using the approved Jaguar diagnostic equipment.</p>
<p>Camera replacement is detected by the CCM, through the recognition of a new serial number during the &lsquo;camera count&rsquo; procedure that takes place during the &lsquo;ignition on&rsquo; phase via the Local Interconnect Network (LIN) bus.</p>
<p>If a new camera is installed calibration must be performed using the diagnostic equipment and the vehicle&rsquo;s Touch Screen (TS). During the calibration procedure, setup software in the control module overlays fine colored lines on the TS highlighting reference points on the bodywork. For example, the mirror camera image must capture the side repeater indicator, the shut-line of the doors and the lower sill trim.</p>
<p>Direction arrows are pressed to shift the image in the desired direction to meet the reference points viewed on the TS.</p>
<p>Adjustments include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Up</li>
<li>Down</li>
<li>Left</li>
<li>Right</li>
<li>Rotation.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the reference points correspond exactly, the setting is saved and the calibration procedure is complete for that camera.</p>
<p>If body repairs are performed that affect the camera system, a calibration procedure must be executed after the repairs are completed.</p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">System Fault</span>
</p>
<p>In the event of camera fault, a Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) is logged in the CCM, and an icon is presented to the driver on the TS where the camera image would normally be viewed.</p>
