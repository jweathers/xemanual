<p></p>
<p>The fuel tank is manufactured using six-layer co-extruded blow-molding technology providing both high mechanical strength and complete emissions integrity. The fuel tank is mounted under the rear seat floorpan, forward of the rear suspension. The fuel tank has a useable capacity of 63 liters (13.9 gallons).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The fuel tank is a saddle tank design which is secured to the vehicle floorpan with two straps which are bolted in position. The fuel filler neck is produced from stainless steel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The fuel tank contains a fuel pump module which collects fuel from both sides of the tank. The pump supplies the engine's fuel demands while also supplying the fuel to power the two venturi. The rapid flow of fuel through the venturi nozzle creates a depression which draws fuel back across the saddle into the pump side of the tank and fills the fuel pump module swirl pot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An internal bracket allows for the attachment of the left fuel pick-up and the passive fuel level sensor 'B'.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An internal breather hose is connected to a stub port passing through the fuel tank casing. An external pipe and hose connect this port to the top of the filler neck. This enables the fuel tank to be filled and controls the fuel cut off during filling.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fuel level inside the tank is monitored by two level sensors.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Roll Over Valve (ROV)</p>
<p>ROV allows vapor to escape to prevent tank pressurization in normal vehicle operating modes; however this valve is designed to close to prevent fuel leakage through the vent in the event of a vehicle roll over. An internal breather hose connects the ROV to a fuel vapor pipe connection on the fuel pump module flange. The fuel vapor is then routed to the evaporative emissions canister where it is stored before being purged at intervals to the engine&rsquo;s intake manifold. For additional information, refer to: Evaporative Emissions (303-13A, Description and Operation).</p>
</div>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Fuel Limit Vent Valve (FLVV)</p>
<p>The FLVV allows the fuel tank to be filled to its maximum, by expelling the air within the fuel tank through an internal breather hose connected to a stub port passing through the fuel tank casing. An external pipe and hose connect this port to the top of the filler neck.For additional information, refer to: Evaporative Emissions (303-13A, Description and Operation).</p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p>The fuel pump module is located in the right side of the tank. The fuel pump module flange is sealed to the tank with an O-ring and secured with a locking ring.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The top flange of the fuel pump module assembly provides the internal and external interface for the tank electrical and fuel connections. The flange is formed with fuel level and fuel pump external electrical connectors that are connected to the active and passive fuel level sensors, and the in-tank fuel pump.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The lower part of the fuel pump module forms the fuel swirl pot, and provides the location for the in-tank fuel pump and the two jet pumps. The swirl pot provides a constant reservoir of fuel for the engine drawn fuel supply.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The pump ensures sufficient fuel is in the swirl pot to supply the engine's High Pressure (HP) fuel pumps demands by supplying the fuel to power the jet pump venturi's. The rapid flow of fuel through the venturi nozzle creates a depression which draws fuel back across the saddle from the left (passive) side of the tank into the pump (active) side of the tank. The second venturi draws fuel from the pump side of the tank into the swirl pot. Surplus fuel entering the fuel swirl pot overflows into the usable right side of the fuel tank.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For cold climate market vehicles that feature a Fuel Fired Booster Heater (FFBH) and an auxiliary fuel pump, the fuel pump module has a separate pipe connection for a fuel supply line that connects to an auxiliary fuel pump mounted on the exterior right side of the fuel tank. This pipe connection is fitted with a sealed suction tube which draws fuel from the swirl pot. An additional fuel line connects the auxiliary fuel pump to the FFBH fuel inlet.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2>FUEL LEVEL SENSORS</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Two fuel level sensors are used to measure the amount of fuel remaining in the left and right sides of the fuel tank. The left passive fuel level sensor 'B' is attached to the tank internal bracket and the right active fuel level sensor 'A' is attached to the outside of the fuel pump swirl pot. Both sensors are connected to the vehicle wiring harness via the external electrical connector on the fuel pump module top flange assembly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The electrical output signal varies to the amount of fuel remaining in each side of the fuel tank and the position of the float arms. The measured resistance is measured by the fuel level sensors and the information passed to the Body Control Module/Gateway Module (BCM/GWM) which implements an anti-slosh function. This monitors the signal and updates the fuel level signal to the instrument cluster at regular intervals, preventing constant pointer movement caused by fuel movement in the tank due to cornering or braking. A low level fuel warning indicator is incorporated in the instrument cluster which illuminates when the fuel level in the tank falls below a predetermined level.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The fuel level sensor signals are converted into Controller Area Network (CAN) bus messages by the BCM/GWM and are used by the instrument cluster for fuel gauge and fuel warning indicator operation and are also monitored by the Engine Control Module (ECM) to store On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) P codes for mis-fire detection when the fuel level is below a predetermined capacity.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The neck of the fuel filler pipe is positioned at the rear of the vehicle, above the right rear wheel. The filler pipe and cap is covered by a molded plastic fuel flap which is electrically locked when the vehicle is locked.</p>
<p>The filler cap is a conventional screw-in type which is secured to the vehicle with a lanyard. The filler cap must be securely fitted to ensure that the tank venting system is sealed. The cap has a locking mechanism which gives an audible click when the cap is correctly tightened.</p>
<p>Failure to correctly secure the cap will result in vapor being lost from the system to atmosphere. </p>
<p>The filler pipe is a stainless steel fabrication which is secured to the vehicle body with two brackets and nuts. A metal stub pipe, attached to the filler neck, provides for the attachment of the breather pipe.</p>
<p>The fuel filler pipe attaches to a stub at the rear of the fuel tank which incorporates a check valve. The in-line check valve is mounted inside the fuel tank inlet stub, and is retained in the closed position by a spring. The check valve is only opened when the vehicle is refueled.</p>
<p>A breather pipe is connected between the fuel filler neck and the fuel tank. The breather pipe enables the fuel tank to be filled, allows for expansion of the fuel vapor and controls the fuel cut off during filling. The fuel vapor is routed to an evaporative emissions canister.</p>
<p>For additional information, refer to: Evaporative Emissions (303-13A, Description and Operation).</p>
<p></p>
<h2>FUEL LOW PRESSURE (LP) SENSOR</h2>
<a name="illus6"></a>
<div class="zoom-image-wrapper">
<div class="image-box">
<a class="zoom-button popup-with-zoom-anim" href="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E112870\en_US\large_img"><i class="fa fa-search-plus"></i></a><img class="example-image" alt="E112870" src="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E112870\en_US\_img"></div>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>The fuel LP sensor is located on a bracket on the top of the engine. It is located in a connector between the fuel supply pipe from the fuel pump module and the LP supply pipe to the High Pressure (HP) fuel pump. The sensor measures the fuel pressure being supplied from the tank mounted fuel pump module to the HP fuel pump.</p>
<p>For additional information, refer to: Electronic Engine Controls (303-14B, Description and Operation).</p>
<p></p>
<h2>FUEL PUMP DRIVER MODULE (FPDM)</h2>
<a name="illus7"></a>
<div class="zoom-image-wrapper">
<div class="image-box">
<a class="zoom-button popup-with-zoom-anim" href="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E173065\en_US\large_img"><i class="fa fa-search-plus"></i></a><img class="example-image" alt="E173065" src="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E173065\en_US\_img"></div>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>The FPDM is attached to a bracket and secured by two nuts to the right side D-pillar behind the right side seat bolster.</p>
<p>The fuel pump operation is regulated by the FPDM which is controlled by the ECM. The FPDM regulates the flow and pressure supplied by controlling the operation of the fuel pump using a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) output.</p>
<p>The FPDM is powered by a supply from the fuel pump relay in the Rear Junction Box (RJB). The fuel pump relay is energized on opening the driver's door, pressing the start button only or pressing the start button and the footbrake (which initiates engine cranking). The FPDM supplies power to the fuel pump, and adjusts the power to control the speed of the fuel pump and the pressure and flow in the fuel delivery line.</p>
<p>A PWM signal from the ECM tells the FPDM the required speed for the fuel pump. The on time of the PWM signal represents half the fuel pump speed, for example; if the PWM signal has an on time of 50%, the FPDM drives the pump at 100%.</p>
<p>The FPDM will only energize the fuel pump if it receives a valid PWM signal, with an on time of between 4% and 50%. To switch the fuel pump off, the ECM transmits a PWM signal with an on time of 75%.</p>
<p>The output pressure from the fuel pump will change with changes of engine demand and fuel temperature. The ECM monitors the input from the fuel Low Pressure (LP) sensor and adjusts the speed of the fuel pump as necessary to maintain a nominal output pressure of 450 kPa (4.5 bar; 65.3 lbf/in&sup2;), except during engine start-up. At engine start-up the target pressure for the fuel delivery line is 630 kPa (6.3 bar; 91.4 lbf/in&sup2;).</p>
<p>If the Restraints Control Module (RCM) outputs a crash signal on the high speed Controller Area Network (CAN) powertrain systems bus, the Body Control Module/Gateway Module (BCM/GWM) de-energizes the fuel pump relay to prevent any further fuel being pumped to the engine.</p>
<p>If the ECM does not detect pressure in the fuel delivery line, it stops, or refuses to start the engine and stores the appropriate Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC).</p>
<p>The ECM receives a monitoring signal from the FPDM. Any DTC's produced by the FPDM are stored by the ECM.</p>
<p>DTC's can be retrieved from the ECM using an approved Jaguar diagnostic system. The FPDM itself cannot be interrogated by the approved Jaguar diagnostic system.</p>
<p></p>

<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">OPERATION</div>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>The GTDi 2.0L Petrol fuel system uses a returnless fuel system. The fuel pump operation is regulated by the Fuel Pump Driver Module (FPDM), which is controlled by the Engine Control Module (ECM). The FPDM regulates the fuel flow and pressure delivered to the engine mounted High Pressure (HP) fuel pump by controlling the operation of the fuel pump using a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) output.</p>
<p>The fuel pump in the fuel delivery module is supplied power via a fuel pump relay in the Rear Junction Box (RJB). The fuel pump relay is controlled by the Body Control Module/GatewayModule (BCM/GWM) and is active when the ignition is in all power modes except for power mode 0 (off). The ECM is connected to the BCM/GWM to receive a 'wake-up' message and in the event of an accident the Restraints Control Module (RCM) outputs a crash signal to the BCM/GWM to disable the fuel pump relay.</p>
<p>Inside the fuel tank there are two fuel level sensors; 'A' and 'B', which output signals to the BCM/GWM for fuel tank fuel level. This information is processed by the BCM/GWM and passed to the instrument cluster to display the remaining fuel level and low fuel warning.</p>
