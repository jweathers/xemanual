<div class="grey-heading">OVERVIEW</div>
</div>
<p>An advanced multi-link rear suspension is introduced providing superior dynamics and refinement with enhanced wheel articulation. The compact design of the rear suspension allows for a generous luggage compartment area. Lightweight aluminium chassis components are used extensively to advance suspension performance by increasing stiffness and reducing un-sprung weight, while also reducing total vehicle weight.</p>

<div class="grey-heading">DESCRIPTION</div>
</div>
<p>The vehicle has a fully independent suspension system with an advanced new multi-link design, which delivers enhanced dynamics and refinement together with a compact layout providing increased vehicle interior space, enabling a more spacious luggage compartment.</p>
<p>The rear suspension has been specifically developed to offer responsive and agile handling together with supreme ride quality and refinement.</p>
<p>Both the rear suspension lower control arm and wheel knuckle are produced from thin-walled hollow aluminium castings, delivering additional weight savings.</p>
<p>The rear suspension is mounted on an optimised steel subframe which is light and stiff for optimum steering response, chassis performance and refinement.</p>

<h2> Upper Control Arm</h2>
<p>The Upper control arm is made from forged aluminum with both ends of the arm having a bush housing machined in the arm; a bush is pressed into each of the housings. The inner end locates in brackets on the upper section of the subframe. The outer end of the arm locates in lugs at the top of the wheel knuckle.</p>
<h2>Lower Control Arm and Tie Bar</h2>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Lower control arm</p>
<p>The lower control arm is cast aluminum with a bushes pressed into the inner section of the arm which provides for the attachment to the subframe. The bushes are located between brackets on the subframe and secured with bolts and nuts. The lower control arm has a platform which provides for the attachment for the coil spring and a location hole for the attachment of the stabilizer-bar link.</p>
</div>
<p>The outer section of the lower control arm has a second bush which attaches to the forward end of the wheel knuckle. A bush at the rearward end of the lower control arm attaches to the wheel knuckle&rsquo;s rear bush by an integral link which provides castor control.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Tie arm</p>
<p>The tie arm is manufactured from forged-aluminium with one end having a bush pressed into a machined bore.</p>
</div>
<p>The inner bush locates between brackets on the subframe and is secured with a special eccentric bolt, washer and nut. This allows for the adjustment of the rear wheel toe. Rotation of the bolt moves the eccentric head within a recessed slot in the bracket, allowing the toe to be adjusted within the set limits.</p>
<h2> Wheel Knuckle and Hub</h2>
<p>The wheel knuckle is an aluminum casting which provides for the attachment of the upper and lower control arms and tie arm. The wheel knuckle also provides the mounting locations for the wheel hub and bearing assembly.</p>
<p>The hub assembly comprises a splined drive-flange and wheel studs. A bearing is pressed into the knuckle and a circlip positioned to assist in retaining the bearing. The hub is then pressed into the bearing. The drive shaft locates into the splines of the hub assembly and secured with a stake nut.</p>
<h2>Stabilizer Bar</h2>
<p>The stabilizer bar is fabricated from hardened steel. The stabilizer bar operates, via a pair of links, from their attachment to the lower control arm.</p>
<p>The stabilizer bar is mounted on the subframe&rsquo;s rear cross member and is attached with two, compression rubber bushes which wind up torsionally in operation. Brackets, which are pressed onto the bushes, are attached to the cross member with bolts. The stabilizer bar has steel crimped, 'anti-shuffle' collars positioned on the inside edges of the bushes. The collars prevent sideways movement of the stabilizer bar.</p>
<p>The stabilizer bar links have a ball-joint at each end, and are fitted with hardened steel washers pressed onto the ball-pins at both ends. The bottom ball joint is attached to the link at 78 degrees to the link axis. The ball-joint is located in a hole in the lower control arm and secured with the hardened steel washer on one side of the interface and a self-locking nut on the other. The top ball-joint is located in a hole in the end of the stabilizer bar and secured with the hardened steel washer on one side of the interface and the self-locking nut on other.</p>
<h2>Spring and Shock Absorber Assembly</h2>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Spring</p>
<p>The coil spring fitted differs with vehicle specification; each spring is color coded to identify its rating and fitment requirements. The spring assembly is supplied with the upper and lower isolators attached.</p>
</div>
<p>The lower end of the coil spring is located in the lower control arm which contains a feature for orientating the spring assembly. The design of the lower isolator prevents the spring rotating. The spring has a linear rate compression and is inclined to counter cornering forces. </p>
<p>The upper-end of the coil spring is also located in a spring isolator underneath the vehicle&rsquo;s body member. Both upper and lower spring isolators are made from rubber and reduce any noise produced during shock absorber and spring compression and extension, from being transmitted to the vehicle body.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Shock Absorber</p>
<p>The shock absorber assembly is a mono-tube design; the lower end of the shock absorber is fitted with a bush and is attached to the wheel knuckle. The shock absorber top mounting is secured to the vehicle's body.</p>
</div>
<p>The shock absorber functions by restricting the flow of hydraulic fluid through internal galleries within the shock absorber. The shock absorber rod moves axially within the shock absorber, its movement limited by the flow of fluid through the galleries, providing damping of undulations in the terrain. The shock absorber rod is sealed at its exit point from the shock absorber body to maintain the fluid within the unit and to prevent the ingress of dirt and moisture. The seal also incorporates a wiper to keep the rod clean. </p>
<p> The threaded outer end of the shock absorber rod locates through a hole in the top mount. A self-locking nut secures the top mount to the shock absorber rod. The shock absorber rod on the adaptive shock absorber has an electrical connector integrated to the end of the shock absorber rod. For additional information, refer to: Vehicle Dynamic Suspension (204-05, Description and Operation).</p>
