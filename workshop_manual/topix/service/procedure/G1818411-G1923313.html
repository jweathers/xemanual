<div class="grey-heading">Controller Area Network (CAN)</div>
</div>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Control Module Connections to the CAN Harness</p>
<p>Control modules are connected to the CAN harness either in a 'loop' or 'spur' configuration. In the 'loop' type configuration the CAN harness loops into the module (via two connector pins) and then loops out of the module (via another two connector pins). In the 'spur' type configuration, a harness spur is spliced into the main 'backbone' of the CAN harness and the module is connected to the harness spur via two connector pins.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">CAN Harness Architecture</p>
<p>For a detailed description of the CAN Networks and architecture, refer to the relevant Description and Operation section in the Workshop Manual.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">CAN Network Integrity Tests</p>
<p>If a control module is suspected of non-communication, the Network Integrity test application available on the manufacturer approved diagnostic system can be used to confirm if communication is possible between the control modules on the vehicle and the manufacturer approved diagnostic system (via the J1962 diagnostic connector ). The results from the test can be used to determine if either a single module or multiple modules are failing to communicate.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">CAN Terminating Modules</p>
<p>If the Network Integrity test indicates that one or more module on one of the CAN networks (HS or MS) are failing to communicate, there are several checks that can be made. The first step is to identify if both of the CAN terminating modules on each individual CAN Bus are communicating. If both CAN terminating modules for each individual CAN Bus are communicating (identified via the Network Integrity test), then it can be confirmed that the main 'backbone' of the CAN harness is complete. The main 'backbone' of the CAN harness consists of all the modules connected to the CAN harness via a 'loop' configuration and also includes the two terminating modules.</p>
</div>
<p>Communication with both CAN terminating modules via the Network Integrity test confirms the physical integrity of the main 'backbone' of the CAN harness (and the harness spur to the J1962 diagnostic connector). This means that there is no requirement to check the resistance of the CAN Network. This is because the standard check for 60 ohms across the CAN High and CAN Low lines will not provide any additional information regarding the physical condition of the CAN harness, beyond what has already been determined from the Network Integrity test. </p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Non-Communication of a Terminating Module</p>
<p>If a Network Integrity test reveals a terminating module is failing to communicate it can indicate a break in the main 'backbone' of the CAN harness. The first checks should always be to confirm the power and ground supplies to the non-communicating module are correct. Providing these are correct, the resistance between the CAN High and CAN Low lines at the J1962 connector can be checked to determine the integrity of the main 'backbone' of the CAN harness. After disconnecting the battery a reading of 120 ohms would indicate an open circuit in the main 'backbone' of the CAN harness. Alternatively, a reading of 60 ohms would indicate that there is no open circuit fault with the main 'backbone' of the CAN harness.</p>
</div>
<p>It is worth noting that even if one of the terminating modules is disconnected from the CAN harness, communications between the modules still connected may still be possible. Therefore communication between the manufacturer approved diagnostic system and the connected modules may also be possible.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Locating CAN Harness Open Circuits</p>
<p>In the case where multiple modules, including a terminating module, are failing to communicate, having first confirmed the power and ground supplies are correct, the approximate location of the open circuit can be identified from analysis of the Network Integrity test results and reference to the relevant CAN network circuit diagrams. For example, if an open circuit existed in a certain position on the CAN harness, any module positioned on the Network between the J1962 connector and the open circuit should return a response during the Network Integrity test. No responses would be returned from any modules past the open circuit fault in the Network.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">CAN Harness 'Spur' Type Configuration Circuits</p>
<p>If, after the initial checks (Network Integrity test using the manufacturer approved diagnostic system, and power and ground supplies to the module have been checked and confirmed as correct), a module that is connected to the CAN harness via a 'spur' type configuration is suspected of not communicating, then the physical integrity of the CAN harness 'spur' can be checked.</p>
</div>
<p>This is most easily undertaken by individually checking the continuity of the CAN High and CAN Low lines between the non-communicating module connector (with the module disconnected) and the J1962 diagnostic connector.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">'Lost Communications' DTCs</p>
<p>As well as the methods described so far in this document, which can be used to determine the location of an open circuit in the CAN harness, 'Lost Communications' DTCs can also be used for this purpose. Lost communication DTCs mean that a module is not receiving CAN information from another module.</p>
</div>
<p>For example, if a global DTC read were to be carried out, only DTCs stored in the modules that the manufacturer approved diagnostic system could communicate with would be displayed. If there was an open circuit fault in a certain position on the CAN harness, the modules that could display DTCs would all be prior to the open circuit on the Network, and these modules should display 'Lost Communications' DTCs with all the modules located on the Network past the open circuit fault.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">'Bus off' DTCs</p>
<p>The references to bus and its condition refer to the network concerned and the modules on that network.</p>
</div>
<p>If a module logs a 'Bus Off' DTC, it means that the module has detected CAN transmission errors and has disabled it's own CAN transmissions and disconnected itself from the network in an attempt to allow the rest of the network to function. At this point the 'Bus Off' DTC is set. A common cause of 'Bus Off' DTCs can be a short circuit in the CAN network.</p>

<div class="grey-heading">BroadR-Reach&reg; Ethernet</div>
</div>
<p>The infotainment control modules use the BroadR-Reach&reg; Ethernet network connection to communicate, for a detailed description of the BroadR-Reach&reg; Ethernet network please refer to the relevant Description and Operation section of the workshop manual. The BroadR-Reach&reg; Ethernet network is constantly monitored by the modules connected, any fault within the BroadR-Reach&reg; Ethernet network raises a DTC in the associated module. For any related diagnostics to the BroadR-Reach&reg; Ethernet network, please check for DTCs and refer to the relevant DTC index.</p>
