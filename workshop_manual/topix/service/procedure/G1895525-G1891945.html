<div class="grey-heading">OVERVIEW</div>
</div>
<p>The Gasoline Turbocharged Direct Injection (GTDi) 2.0L petrol engine is an in-line, double overhead camshaft, four cylinder engine, which is longitudinally mounted in the engine compartment. The engine management system is controlled by an Powertrain Control Module (PCM) located in the engine compartment. The PCM uses inputs from various sensors to control actuators to achieve optimum conditions of all aspects of engine running, emissions and performance.</p>
<p>The electronic engine control system controls the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Charge air</li>
<li>Fueling</li>
<li>Ignition timing</li>
<li>Valve timing</li>
<li>Cylinder knock</li>
<li>Idle speed</li>
<li>Engine cooling fan</li>
<li>Evaporative emissions</li>
<li>OBD (On-Board Diagnostic)</li>
<li>Immobilization system interface</li>
<li>Speed control.</li>
</ul>
<p>The engine uses a returnless, high pressure direct injection fuel system, with seven hole injectors to supply the cylinders. An in tank, low pressure pump delivers fuel to an engine mounted high pressure pump, driven from the exhaust camshaft. Both pumps are controlled by the PCM.</p>
<p>The Borg-Warner K03 turbocharger is located on the exhaust manifold and features a pressure controlled, solenoid operated turbine intake and water cooled bearing housing.</p>
<p>The double overhead camshafts use Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT) which allows the timing of the intake and exhaust valves to be adjusted independently of each other. The system is operated by two VCT solenoids which are controlled by the PCM using information from two Camshaft Position (CMP) sensors.</p>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">DESCRIPTION</div>
</div>
<h2>Powertrain Control Module (PCM)</h2>
<p>The Powertrain Control Module (PCM) is located at the rear of the engine compartment, between the bulkhead and the engine sound insulation. The PCM is located in a plastic molded carrier which in turn is located in a bracket attached to the vehicle structure.</p>
<p>The PCM is connected to the vehicle harnesses via two connectors. The PCM contains data processors and memory microchips. The output signals to the actuators are in the form of ground paths provided by driver circuits within the PCM. Some output signals take the form of high side drive signals or low side drive signals. The PCM driver circuits produce heat during normal operation and dissipate this heat via the ribbed casing. </p>
<p>The PCM performs self diagnostic routines and stores fault codes in its memory. These fault codes and diagnostics can be accessed using a Jaguar approved diagnostic system.</p>
<p>If the PCM is to be replaced, the new PCM is supplied 'blank' and must be configured to the vehicle using a Jaguar approved diagnostic system. A 'flash' Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM) allows the PCM to be externally configured, using a Jaguar approved diagnostic system, with market specific or new tune. The current engine tune data can be accessed and read using a Jaguar approved diagnostic system. When a new PCM is fitted, it must also be synchronized to the Body Control Module/Gateway Module (BCM/GWM) assembly using a Jaguar approved diagnostic system.</p>
<p>PCM's cannot be 'swapped' between vehicles.</p>
<h2>Camshaft Position (CMP) Sensors </h2>
<a name="illus4"></a>
<div class="zoom-image-wrapper">
<div class="image-box">
<a class="zoom-button popup-with-zoom-anim" href="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E134411\en_US\large_img"><i class="fa fa-search-plus"></i></a><img class="example-image" alt="E134411" src="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E134411\en_US\_img"></div>
</div>
<p>Two Camshaft Position (CMP) sensors are used; one for the inlet camshaft and one for exhaust camshaft. The sensors are located on the top of the camshaft cover and are each sealed with an O-ring seal and secured with a bolt to the cover.</p>
<p>The sensors are Hall effect sensors which read off a target on each camshaft. Each sensor receives a 5V reference voltage from the PCM. Two further connections to the PCM provide ground and signal output. The PCM uses the signals from the CMP sensors and the Crankshaft Position (CKP) sensor to determine current camshaft position and camshaft adjustment.</p>
<p>If a fault occurs with one or both CMP sensors, a Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) is registered in the PCM. Two types of failure can occur; camshaft signal frequency too high or total failure of the camshaft signal. The DTC recorded by the PCM can also relate to a total failure of the crankshaft signal or crankshaft signal dynamically implausible. Both components should be checked to determine the cause of the fault.</p>
<p>If a fault occurs with a CMP sensor when the engine is running, the engine will continue to run. Once the engine is switched off, the engine will crank and restart while the fault is present, but Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT) control will be disabled.</p>
<h2>Crankshaft Position (CKP) Sensor</h2>
<a name="illus5"></a>
<div class="zoom-image-wrapper">
<div class="image-box">
<a class="zoom-button popup-with-zoom-anim" href="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E134412\en_US\large_img"><i class="fa fa-search-plus"></i></a><img class="example-image" alt="E134412" src="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E134412\en_US\_img"></div>
</div>
<p>The Crankshaft Position (CKP) sensor is located at the front of the engine, adjacent to the crankshaft pulley/vibration damper. The sensor is secured to two bosses on the engine front cover and secured with two bolts. The sensor receives a 5V reference voltage from the PCM. Two further connections to the PCM provide ground and signal output.</p>
<p>The CKP sensor is positioned adjacent to the trigger wheel, which is an integral part of the crankshaft pulley/vibration damper. The trigger wheel has 58 teeth and a section where 2 teeth are missing. The sensor is a Hall effect sensor which uses the missing teeth on the trigger wheel to determine the crankshaft position and rotational speed.</p>
<p>If a fault occurs with the CKP sensor, a Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) is registered in the PCM. If the sensor fails when the engine is running the engine will stall and will not restart until the fault has been corrected.</p>
<p>The PCM uses the signal from the CKP sensor for the following functions:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Synchronization.</li>
<li>Determine fuel injection timing.</li>
<li>Produce an engine speed signal which is broadcast on the High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) powertrain systems bus for use by other systems.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mass Air Flow and Temperature (MAFT) Sensor</h2>
<a name="illus6"></a>
<div class="zoom-image-wrapper">
<div class="image-box">
<a class="zoom-button popup-with-zoom-anim" href="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E134413\en_US\large_img"><i class="fa fa-search-plus"></i></a><img class="example-image" alt="E134413" src="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E134413\en_US\_img"></div>
</div>
<p>The Mass Air Flow and Temperature (MAFT) sensor is located on the top cover of the air filter box and is secured with two screws. The sensor is downstream of the air filter and measures the air entering the clean air duct to the turbocharger.</p>
<p>The MAFT sensor receives a 12V power supply from the Engine Junction Box (EJB). Three further connections provide signal feedback to the PCM for intake air temperature and air volume.</p>
<p>The MAFT sensor works on the hot film principle. Two sensing elements are contained within a film. One element is maintained at ambient (air intake) temperature, for example 25 &deg;C (77 &deg;F). The other element is heated to 200 &deg;C (392 &deg;F) above the ambient temperature, approximately 225 &deg;C (437 &deg;F). The intake air entering the engine passes through the MAFT sensor and has a cooling effect on the film. The PCM monitors the current required to maintain the 200 &deg;C (392 &deg;F) differential between the two elements and uses the differential to provide a precise, non-linear, frequency based signal which equates to the volume of air being drawn into the engine.</p>
<p>The MAFT sensor output is a digital signal related to the mass of the incoming air. The PCM uses this data, in conjunction with signals from other sensors and information from stored fueling maps, to determine the precise fuel quantity to be injected into the cylinders.</p>
<p>The PCM checks the calculated air mass against the engine speed. If the calculated air mass is not plausible, the PCM uses a default air mass figure which is derived from the average engine speed compared to a stored characteristic map. The air mass value will be corrected using values for charge pressure, atmospheric pressure and air temperature. If the MAFT sensor fails the PCM implements the default strategy based on engine speed.</p>
<p>In the event of a MAFT sensor signal failure, any of the following symptoms may be observed:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Difficult starting. </li>
<li>Engine stalls after starting.</li>
<li>Delayed engine response.</li>
<li>Emission control inoperative.</li>
<li>Idle speed control inoperative.</li>
<li>Reduced engine performance.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) Sensor </h2>
<a name="illus7"></a>
<div class="zoom-image-wrapper">
<div class="image-box">
<a class="zoom-button popup-with-zoom-anim" href="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E134433\en_US\large_img"><i class="fa fa-search-plus"></i></a><img class="example-image" alt="E134433" src="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E134433\en_US\_img"></div>
</div>
<p>A single Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor is located in the intake manifold and is secured with one screw. The sensor provides a voltage signal to the PCM relative to the intake manifold pressure.</p>
<p>The MAP sensor has a three pin connector which is connected to the PCM and provides a 5V reference voltage from the PCM, a signal input and a ground connection.</p>
<p>The MAP sensor uses a diaphragm transducer to measure the air pressure which allows the PCM to detect quick pressure changes in the intake manifold after the electric throttle. The signal is used in conjunction with the MAFT sensor signal to calculate the injection period.</p>
<p>The PCM monitors the MAP sensor for faults and can store fault related Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC)'s. These can be retrieved using a Jaguar approved diagnostic system. If the sensor fails, the PCM uses the MAFT sensor signal value as a substitute.</p>
<h2>Engine Coolant Temperature (ECT) Sensor</h2>

</div>
<p>On vehicles in all markets an Engine Coolant Temperature (ECT) sensor 1 is located in the water outlet on the cylinder head. On NAS market vehicles an additional ECT sensor 2 is used which is mounted in the radiator lower hose connector, adjacent to the radiator. The ECT 2 sensor measures the radiator outlet temperature.</p>
<p>The ECT 1 sensor provides the PCM and the Instrument Cluster (IC) with engine coolant temperature status. The additional ECT 2 sensor used on NAS vehicles enables the PCM to monitor the operation of the thermostat.</p>
<p>The PCM uses the temperature information for the following functions:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Fueling calculations.</li>
<li>Limit engine operation if engine coolant temperature becomes too high.</li>
<li>Cooling fan operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The IC uses the temperature information for temperature gauge operation. The ECT signal is transmitted on the High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) powertrain systems bus by the PCM for use by the IC and other systems.</p>
<p>The ECT sensor circuit consists of a voltage divider which incorporates the Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistor within the ECT sensor. The input to the sensor is a 5V reference voltage supplied through a resistor within the PCM. The ground from the sensor is also connected to the PCM which measures the voltage across the sensor. As the coolant temperature rises the resistance of the sensor decreases and vice versa. The output voltage from the sensor changes as the thermistor allows more current to pass to ground relative to the temperature of the coolant. The PCM calculates the coolant temperature from a map of sensor voltage against temperature.</p>
<p>The PCM adjusts fuel delivery for the measured coolant temperature to ensure optimum driveability at all times. The engine will require more fuel when it is cold to overcome fuel condensing on the cold metal surfaces inside the combustion chamber. To achieve a richer air/fuel ratio, the PCM extends the injector opening time. As the engine warms up the air/fuel ratio is leaned off.</p>
<p>If the ECT sensor fails, the following symptoms may be observed:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Difficult cold starting.</li>
<li>Difficult hot starting.</li>
<li>Reduced engine performance.</li>
<li>Temperature gauge inoperative or inaccurate reading.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event of ECT sensor signal failure, the PCM applies a default value of 80 &deg;C (176 &deg;F) coolant temperature for fueling purposes.</p>
<h2>Engine Oil Temperature Sensor</h2>
<a name="illus9"></a>
<div class="zoom-image-wrapper">
<div class="image-box">
<a class="zoom-button popup-with-zoom-anim" href="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E148277\en_US\large_img"><i class="fa fa-search-plus"></i></a><img class="example-image" alt="E148277" src="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E148277\en_US\_img"></div>
</div>
<p>The engine oil temperature sensor is located in a hole in the underside of the oil pan. The sensor is sealed to the oil pan with a rubber gasket and secured with three screws. The temperature sensor is a NTC type sensor which operates in the -40 &deg;C (-40 &deg;F) to 159 &deg;C (318 &deg;F) temperature range. The sensor receives a 5V reference voltage supplied through a resistor within the PCM and returns a voltage to the PCM relative to the oil temperature and resistance through the NTC sensor.</p>
<h2>Oil Pressure Switch</h2>
<a name="illus10"></a>
<div class="zoom-image-wrapper">
<div class="image-box">
<a class="zoom-button popup-with-zoom-anim" href="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E134415\en_US\large_img"><i class="fa fa-search-plus"></i></a><img class="example-image" alt="E134415" src="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E134415\en_US\_img"></div>
</div>
<p>The oil pressure switch is located in a threaded port in the oil filter adaptor. The switch contacts are closed and ground an input to the Body Control Module/Gateway Module (BCM/GWM) assembly when insufficient oil pressure is present or the engine is not running. The switch contacts are open at a minimum engine oil pressure of 0.15 to 0.41 bar (2.2 to 5.9 lbf/in&sup2;).</p>
<p>The oil pressure switch is connected directly to the BCM/GWM assembly. The BCM/GWM assembly outputs the engine oil pressure state on the High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) powertrain systems bus for use by the Instrument Cluster (IC). This message informs the IC if the switch is open or closed. The IC then turns the warning indicator on or off accordingly.</p>
<h2>Brake Pedal Switch</h2>
<a name="illus11"></a>
<div class="zoom-image-wrapper">
<div class="image-box">
<a class="zoom-button popup-with-zoom-anim" href="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E173148\en_US\large_img"><i class="fa fa-search-plus"></i></a><img class="example-image" alt="E173148" src="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E173148\en_US\_img"></div>
</div>
<p>The brake pedal switch is mounted on the brake pedal bracket. The brake pedal switch is a combined switch, contains a stop lamp switch and a brake test switch in one housing. The stop lamp switch is normally open, the brake test switch is normally closed to ground.</p>
<p>Both switches are connected directly to the Body Control Module/Gateway Module (BCM/GWM) assembly and the PCM. The PCM uses the switches for diagnostic and speed control functions.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Brake Test Switch</p>
<p>The brake test switch opens a ground path when the brake pedal is depressed. The ground path is used to determine switch and brake pedal operation. The PCM can determine the operation of the brake test switch and the status of the switch can be read using a Jaguar approved diagnostic system.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Stop lamp switch </p>
<p>The stop lamp switch receives a permanent 12V fused supply from the BCM/GWM assembly and when the brake pedal is depressed passes a signal voltage to both the BCM/GWM assembly and the PCM. The PCM can determine the operation of the stop lamp switch and the status of the switch can be read using a Jaguar approved diagnostic system. </p>
</div>
<p>The Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) control module, the PCM and the BCM/GWM assembly use the signals from the brake pedal switch and also the brake pressure sensor to perform plausibility checks. If one of the switches fails, the diagnostic checks will be aware of the fault and the brake warning indicator in the Instrument Cluster (IC) will be illuminated.</p>
<h2>Accelerator Pedal Position (APP) Sensor</h2>
<a name="illus12"></a>
<div class="zoom-image-wrapper">
<div class="image-box">

</div>
<p>The Accelerator Pedal Position (APP) sensor allows the PCM to determine the driver requests for vehicle speed, acceleration and deceleration. The PCM uses this information to determine the torque demand from the engine via injection control.</p>
<p>The APP sensor consists of a twin track rotary potentiometer integrated into the mounting bracket of the accelerator pedal. The APP sensor receives two separate electrical supplies and generates two different outputs. Both tracks are analogue output signals connected to the PCM. Both signals contain the same positional information, but the secondary track has half the voltage output of the primary track.</p>
<p>The PCM uses the APP sensor information to calculate driver demand. This and other information is used to calculate the required position of the throttle disc in the electric throttle body. The PCM then actuates the motor in the electric throttle assembly to move the throttle disc to the correct angle in relation to the pedal position.</p>
<p>If there is a fault with either track, the vehicle enters reduced performance mode and a reduced performance warning will be displayed. If both analogue signals have a fault, the engine adopts a constant high speed of 1300 RPM to allow the vehicle to move. Torque application and reduction of engine speed back to 1000 RPM can be subsequently controlled via brake pedal switch operation.</p>
<p>The PCM constantly checks the range and plausibility of the two signals and stores a DTC if it detects a fault. The APP sensor position and any stored DTCs can be read using a Jaguar approved diagnostic system.</p>

<p>The turbine bypass control actuator is attached to a bracket which is attached to the turbocharger compressor housing. </p>
<p>The solenoid valve is controlled by the PCM to control the turbocharger charge pressure using signals from the charge air pressure and temperature sensor. The PCM operates the valve using a 12V Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal to modulate the air pressure supplied to the turbine bypass control actuator at a minimum of 20 Hz.</p>
<p>The solenoid valve is a three-way valve with three hose connections. The first hose discharges excess pressurized air from the pressure actuator into the air inlet to the turbocharger, the second hose receives pressurized air from the compressor housing and the third hose supplies pressurized air to the turbine bypass control actuator. The valve connects the pressurized air from the compressor to either the bypass actuator or discharges the pressure into the turbocharger intake.</p>
<p>The PCM can monitor the solenoid valve operation and record DTCs. The solenoid valve has a resistance value of 23 Ohms &plusmn; 1.2 Ohms.</p>

<h2>Fuel Pump Driver Module (FPDM)</h2>
<p>The Fuel Pump Driver Module (FPDM) is located in the right side of the passenger compartment behind the rear seat backrest. The FPDM is attached to the right rear wheel housing inner panel and secured with two nuts.</p>
<p>The Low Pressure (LP) fuel pump (located in the fuel tank) operation is regulated by the FPDM which is controlled by a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal, output by the PCM. The FPDM regulates the fuel flow and pressure output of the LP pump by controlling the fuel pump using a PWM output.</p>
<p>The FPDM is powered by a fused power supply from the fuel pump relay in the Rear Junction Box (RJB). The BCM/GWM assembly operates the fuel pump relay when the driver door is opened or when engine crank is initiated using the stop/start button. The FPDM supplies power to the fuel pump, and adjusts the power to control the speed of the fuel pump and thus the pressure and flow in the low pressure fuel delivery line.

The sensor measures the fuel pressure being supplied from the tank mounted fuel pump module to the HP fuel pump.</p>
<p>The LP fuel sensor is a piezo resistor type sensor. The sensor receives a 5V reference voltage supplied through a resistor within the PCM and produces an analogue signal of between 0 and 5V depending on the pressure sensed.

<h2>Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT) Solenoid Valves</h2>

<p>The Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT) solenoids are located in the camshaft cover at the front of the engine. Each valve is sealed in the cover with o-ring seals and secured with a bolt. Both solenoids are located in the front camshaft bearing cap which has internal drillings to direct pressurized oil to the VCT actuators.</p>
<p>The VCT solenoid comprises an electro-magnetic valve with a spring loaded piston. Slots in the piston allow oil to be channeled to the VCT actuator. The VCT actuators rotate the inlet and exhaust camshafts to adjust the camshaft timing as required. The direction in which the camshaft is rotated is dependent on the chamber in the VCT actuator which is supplied with oil pressure from the slot in the VCT solenoid piston.</p>
<p>An oil filter is located in the front camshaft bearing cap to prevent contaminants affecting the function of the solenoid valves.</p>
<p>Each VCT solenoid receives a fused battery supply via the EJB 2. Operation of the solenoid valves is controlled by the PCM. The PCM provides a PWM ground for the VCT solenoid. This allows oil to be directed to different chambers in the VCT actuators at variable rates, allowing the inlet and exhaust camshaft angle positions to be controlled independently and precisely.</p>

</div>
<p>Two Heated Oxygen Sensors (HO2S) are used by the PCM to measure the oxygen content of the exhaust gasses leaving the engine. The pre-catalyst HO2S measures the gases before they pass through the catalytic converter and the post-catalyst HO2S measures the gases after they have passed through the catalytic converter.</p>
<p>The HO2S comprises a solid electrolyte Zirconium dioxide cell surrounded by a gas permeable ceramic coating. The output voltage from the sensor is dependent on the level of Oxygen (O2) passing through the permeable ceramic coating. Nominal voltage for λ=1 is 300 to 500mV. As the fuel/air mixture becomes richer (λ&lt;1) the voltage rises to up to 900mV. As the mixture becomes weaker (λ&gt;1) the voltage falls towards 0mV.</p>
<p>Both HO2Ss receive a 12V fused battery supply via the PCM relay in the EJB 2. </p>
<p>The HO2S receive a fused 12V power supply from the PCM relay in the EJB 2. The front HO2S is connected to the PCM on five wires and the rear HO2S is connected to the PCM on three wires. The sensor connections provide power input, ground and analog input and output to the PCM.</p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">Pre-Heating</span>
</p>
<p>The HO2S operate efficiently at temperatures above 300 &deg;C (572 &deg;F). The normal operating temperature is between 300 &deg;C and 850 &deg;C (572 &deg;F and 1562 &deg;F). In order to reach the optimum operating temperature quickly, the HO2S is electrically pre-heated by the PCM. Pre-heating the sensors also prevents condensation which can damage the sensor.</p>
<p>Each HO2S contains a Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) resistor which functions as the heating coil. The resistor is supplied with 12V current from the PCM relay in the EJB 2 and the PCM provides the ground for the resistor. When the sensor PTC resistor coil is cold, resistance through the resistor will be low allowing a high current to pass, heating the coil. The PCM controls the current using a PWM ground. As the resistor coil heats up, the resistance through the coil increases, reducing the current flow. The PCM reduces the duty cycle of the PWM ground until a continuous ground is provided. The PCM uses a PWM ground to prevent damage to the sensor by thermal shock due to the sensor heating up too quickly.</p>
<p>The PTC resistor coil is heated following an engine start for approximately 20 seconds and also during low load conditions where the exhaust gas temperature is insufficient to maintain the optimum sensor temperature. The PCM can diagnose faults in the PTC resistor and can record DTCs which can be retrieved using a Jaguar approved diagnostic system.</p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">Pre-Catalyst HO2S </span>
</p>
<p>The pre-catalyst HO2S is located in the exhaust outlet pipe between the turbocharger and the catalytic converter.</p>
<p>The pre-catalyst HO2S is used by the PCM to monitor the oxygen content of the exhaust gases leaving the engine before they reach the catalytic converter. The PCM will check the output from the HO2S to determine the combustion mixture and ensure λ=1 is obtained. λ=1 is the optimum air/fuel ratio which relates to a mixture of 14.7 kg air per 1 kg of fuel (14.7:1). </p>
<p>The HO2S uses current regulation and outputs a linear signal dependent on the ratio of exhaust gas oxygen to ambient oxygen. The oxygen content of the exhaust gasses is measured by comparing it with ambient air drawn into the HO2S.</p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">Post Catalyst HO2S </span>
</p>
<p>The post catalyst HO2S is located in the exhaust system between the catalytic converter and the flange connection for the center section exhaust. The rear HO2S is used by the PCM to monitor the oxygen content of the exhaust gasses leaving the catalytic converter. The PCM can use this information to check (when the conditions for catalyst diagnostics have been met) for correct operation of the catalytic converter. The PCM uses the information from the rear HO2S to enhance the signals from the front HO2S.</p>
<p>The rear HO2S is similar in its construction to the front HO2S with the exception of the output signal to the PCM. The output signal is a binary signal where the amplitude of the signal curve changes considerably when the oxygen content in the exhaust gases changes. The oxygen content of the exhaust gases leaving the catalytic converter are measured by comparing it with ambient air drawn into the HO2S.</p>

<p>Four ignition coils are fitted directly to the spark plugs and are located in the center of the camshaft cover. The two inner coils for cylinders 2 and 3 are secured to the camshaft cover with screws and the two outer coils for cylinders 1 and 4 are secured with two studs and nuts.</p>
<p>The ignition coils are each connected to the PCM by a signal wire for the PCM to operate the coil. A second wire from the coil goes to a splice in the harness supplying the coil with a ground signal. The third connection on the coil is a fused 12V power supply from the PCM relay in the Engine Junction Box (EJB).</p>
<p>Each coil contains a power stage which controls the primary current. The PCM controls the spark timing and production by switching the power stage of each coil to ground allowing the coil to charge up and then produce a spark at the spark plug at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>The primary coil resistance is 0.730 Ohms - 0.08 Ohms + 0.07 Ohms.</p>

<h2>Electric Throttle</h2>
<a name="illus23"></a>
<div class="zoom-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>The electric throttle is located at the entrance of the intake manifold and is secured to the manifold with four Torx head bolts.</p>
<p>The electric throttle comprises the throttle body, a round throttle disc which is actuated by a motor and a Throttle Position Sensor (TPS). The electric throttle is controlled by the PCM which receives positional signals from the TPS. If a failure of the motor occurs, the throttle disc is returned to an emergency position by the springs, the throttle disc remains partially open with limited engine speed available to the driver.</p>
<p>The electric throttle has six wires which are connected to the PCM. Two wires supply 12V current and ground for the Direct Current (DC) motor. Four more wires connected to the TPS. Two wires supply a 5V reference voltage and a ground to two analogue Hall effect sensors. Two further wires provide the TPS negative and positive signal feedback to the PCM. As the throttle angle increases, the output of the negative sensor decreases and the output of the positive sensor increases.</p>
<p>The motor is a DC damper motor which drives a gear wheel and two springs, one for opening and one for closing. The motor rotates the spindle to which the throttle disc is attached. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals from the PCM control the motor to adjust the position of the throttle disc, regulating the amount of air entering the inlet manifold for combustion. Movement of the motor is achieved by changing the polarity of the power supply to the DC motor, allowing it to be operated in both directions.</p>
<p>The throttle disc and the motor has two maximum positions</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Throttle disc closed which allows minimal air flow through the electric throttle into the intake manifold.</li>
<li>Throttle disc open which allows maximum air flow into the intake manifold.</li>
</ul>
<p>The PCM calculates the throttle disc position by comparing the feedback signals to stored values at a known datum position. The two signals are also compared to ensure that they show an accurate throttle disc position. The PCM performs a self-test and a calibration routine on the throttle disc position at each ignition cycle. This is achieved by the PCM powering the damper motor to fully close the throttle disc and, if required, fully open the throttle disc.</p>
<p>The PCM monitors the DC damper motor and the TPS for faults and can store fault related DTCs. These can be retrieved using a Jaguar approved diagnostic system.</p>
<h2>Knock Sensor</h2>
<a name="illus24"></a>
<div class="zoom-image-wrapper">
<div class="image-box">
<a class="zoom-button popup-with-zoom-anim" href="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E134430\en_US\large_img"><i class="fa fa-search-plus"></i></a><img class="example-image" alt="E134430" src="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E134430\en_US\_img"></div>
</div>
<p>Two knock sensors are installed on the left side of the cylinder block, below the intake manifold. One mid-way between cylinders 1 and 2, and one mid-way between cylinders 3 and 4. Each knock sensor is secured with a single screw. On each knock sensor, a two pin electrical connector provides the interface with the engine harness.</p>
<p>The knock sensors are piezo-ceramic sensors that allow the PCM to employ active knock control and prevent engine damage from pre-ignition or detonation. Knocking or 'pinking' describes the combustion process in which flame speeds in the region of the speed of sound occur. This can happen towards the end of the combustion process if, after the normal combustion process has started, unburnt air/fuel mixture on the combustion chamber walls self ignites under increasing pressure. These pressure peaks can damage the pistons, cylinder head gasket and the cylinder head.</p>
<p>The PCM compares the signals from the knock sensors with mapped values stored in memory to determine when detonation occurs on individual cylinders. When detonation is detected, the PCM retards the ignition timing on that cylinder for a number of engine cycles, then gradually returns it to the original setting.</p>
<p>The PCM cancels closed loop control of the ignition system if the signal received from a knock sensor becomes implausible. In these circumstances the PCM defaults to base mapping which includes an offset for the ignition timing. This ensures the engine will not become damaged if low quality fuel is used. The Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) will illuminate in all markets except Rest Of World (ROW), although the driver may notice that the engine 'pinks' in some driving conditions and displays a drop in performance and smoothness. The PCM calculates the default value if one sensor fails on each pair of cylinders.</p>
<h2>Engine mounting solenoid</h2>
<p>The engine mounting solenoid is attached to a bracket which is secured to the transmission housing. The engine mounting solenoid switches the engine mountings to a softer stiffness at idle to improve the Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) characteristics of the engine at idle. The solenoid receives a fused 12V battery supply via the EJB 2, and a ground connection which is switched by the PCM. At idle engine speed, the PCM connects the solenoid to ground. The solenoid softens both side engine mounts by applying a vacuum. At load conditions the PCM disconnects the solenoid ground connection, which stiffens both engine mounts by removing the vacuum.</p>
<p>The PCM monitors the engine mounting solenoid for faults and can store fault related DTCs. These can be retrieved using a Jaguar approved diagnostic system.</p>

<p>The Powertrain Control Module (PCM) is connected to the engine sensors which allow it to monitor the engine operating conditions. The PCM processes these signals and decides the actions necessary to maintain optimum engine performance in terms of driveability, fuel efficiency and exhaust emissions. The memory of the PCM is programmed with instructions for how to control the engine, this known as the strategy. The memory also contains data in the form of maps which the PCM uses as a basis for fueling and emission control. By comparing the information from the sensors to the data in the maps, the PCM is able to calculate the various output requirements.</p>

<p>The PCM outputs controlling signals to the following sensors and actuators:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Electric throttle.</li>
<li>Fuel Pump Driver Module (FPDM).</li>
<li>Fuel metering valve.</li>
<li>Fuel injectors (4 of).</li>
<li>Ignition coils (4 of).</li>
<li>Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT) solenoids (2 of).</li>
<li>Engine cooling fan control module.</li>
<li>Purge valve.</li>
<li>Turbine bypass control actuator.</li>
<li>PCM relay located in the Engine Junction Box (EJB) 2.</li>
<li>Starter motor relay located in the EJB 2.</li>
<li>Generator.</li>
<li>Diagnostic Module Tank Leakage (DMTL) pump (NAS market vehicles only).</li>
</ul>
<p>The PCM contains an adaptive strategy which updates the system when components vary due to production tolerances or ageing. Some sensors receive a regulated 5 Volt supply from the PCM.</p>
<p>The PCM receives a vehicle speed signal on the High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) powertrain systems bus from the Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) control module. Vehicle speed is an important input to the PCM strategies. The ABS control module derives the speed signal from the wheel speed sensors. The frequency of this signal changes according to road speed.</p>
<p>The PCM uses this signal to determine the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>How much to reduce engine torque during gear changes.</li>
<li>When to permit speed control operation.</li>
<li>To control the operation of the speed control system.</li>
<li>Implementation of the idle strategy when the vehicle is stationary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ignition is controlled by a direct ignition system, provided by four plug top coils. The PCM is able to detect and correct for ignition knock on each cylinder and adjust the ignition timing for each cylinder to achieve optimum performance.</p>
<p>The PCM controls operation of the starter motor via the starter relay in the Engine Junction Box (EJB) 2. The PCM also protects the starter motor, preventing operation of the starter relay if the engine speed signal exceeds a predetermined value.</p>
<p>The PCM and the BCM/GWM assembly exchange encrypted data to validate and approve an engine start.
