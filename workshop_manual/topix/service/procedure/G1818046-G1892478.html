<p>The active anti-theft system monitors the hinged panels for unauthorized opening. In some markets the anti-theft system also incorporates monitoring of the vehicle interior and vehicle tilt sensing.</p>
<p>The active anti-theft alarm system is controlled by the following body system control modules:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>BCM/GWM (Body Control Module/Gateway Module).</li>
<li>DDM (Driver Door Module).</li>
<li>PDM (Passenger Door Module).</li>
<li>RDM (Rear Door Module) left and right.</li>
<li>IC (Instrument Cluster).</li>
</ul>
<p>The BCM/GWM is the main controller in the system. The BCM/GWM controls the following security functions, in addition to other vehicle functions:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Single Locking, Double locking and unlocking (both global and single point entry).</li>
<li>Monitoring of hood switch and ajar switches in the door latches and the luggage compartment lid latch of the CDL (Central Door Locking) system</li>
<li>Volumetric sensor.</li>
<li>Tilt sensor.</li>
<li>Security Sounder - BBUS (Battery Back Up Sounder), or Passive Sounder, and vehicle horns (market dependent).</li>
<li>Arming, disarming and passive arming (market dependent).</li>
<li>Panic alarm function.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two levels of vehicle anti-theft alarm are available: Perimeter Sensing and Perimeter Sensing with Alarm Sensor(s) (Volumetric sensor (market dependent), Tilt sensor (market dependent)).</p>
<p>Perimeter Sensing &ndash; all apertures (doors, luggage compartment lid and hood) are monitored for ajar status (doors ajar and latch status change) and a visual (via directional indicators) and audible alarm is emitted (via Security Sounder and Vehicle Horns (market dependent)) in the event of unauthorized access. The alarm is also triggered in the event of an unauthorized ignition request.</p>
<p>Perimeter Sensing with Alarm Sensor(s) - Volumetric Sensor (market dependent), Tilt Sensor (market dependent).</p>
<p>Perimeter Sensing &ndash; all apertures (doors, luggage compartment lid and hood) are monitored for ajar status (doors ajar and latch status change) and a visual (via directional indicators) and audible alarm is emitted (via Security Sounder and Vehicle Horns (market dependent)) in the event of unauthorized access. The alarm is also triggered in the event of an unauthorized ignition request.</p>
<p>Volumetric Sensor (market dependent) - The passenger compartment interior is monitored for intrusion into the passenger compartment and a visual (via directional indicators) and audible alarm is emitted (via Security Sounder and Vehicle Horns (market dependent)) in the event of unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Tilt Sensor (market dependent) - The vehicle position reference the ground it sits on is monitored for unauthorized movement and a visual (via directional indicators) and audible alarm is emitted (via Security Sounder and Vehicle Horns (market dependent)) in the event of unauthorized movement. </p>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTE:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<p>Volumetric mode and tilt sensing are not available in certain markets.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The smart key provides the following functionality:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Unlock (central unlock or single point entry).</li>
<li>Single Lock and Double lock (market dependent). </li>
<li>Tailgate release.</li>
<li>Approach lighting.</li>
<li>Panic alarm.</li>
</ul>
<p>The lock and unlock switches also control a 'lazy' lock and unlock feature (market dependent) which will automatically close or open the windows with an extended press of the applicable switch. This feature is only available in certain markets and is controlled in conjunction with the door modules.</p>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="warning-alert">WARNING:</div>

<p>The smart key contains an emergency access key. This can be used in the event of failure of the smart key or the vehicle battery to unlock the vehicle. The driver door handle contains a concealed mechanical key barrel which can be used with the emergency key to access the vehicle. This will not disable the perimeter or alarm sensor(s) systems and the visual and audible alarm will be activated when the door is unlocked/opened. To cancel the alarm, the smart key must be held next to the IAU (Immobilizer Antenna Unit) and the stop/start switch must be pressed.</p>
<p>Emergency Locking &ndash; On each shut face of each door there is an emergency locking aperture. This is for use with the emergency access key in the event of a failure of the vehicle battery, to lock the vehicle. Remove the cover and insert the key into the aperture to mechanically lock each door in turn, the driver&rsquo;s door being the last door to be locked. Please ensure that the key is removed from the emergency locking aperture before each door is closed.</p>

<h2>Vehicle Horns</h2>
<a name="illus4"></a>
<div class="zoom-image-wrapper">
<div class="image-box">
<a class="zoom-button popup-with-zoom-anim" href="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E134261\en_US\large_img"><i class="fa fa-search-plus"></i></a><img class="example-image" alt="E134261" src="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E134261\en_US\_img"></div>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>The vehicle horns are located above the front bumper armature. The horns are switched via the steering wheel, connected through the Clockspring (CLKSPG) to the BCM/GWM which activates the horns as a secondary security sounder when the alarm is triggered.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Battery Back Up Sounder (BBUS)</h2>
<a name="illus5"></a>
<div class="zoom-image-wrapper">
<div class="image-box">
<a class="zoom-button popup-with-zoom-anim" href="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E134262\en_US\large_img"><i class="fa fa-search-plus"></i></a><img class="example-image" alt="E134262" src="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E134262\en_US\_img"></div>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>The BBUS is located in the right side of engine bay on RHD (Right Hand Drive) vehicles and in the left side of the engine bay on LHD (Left Hand Drive) vehicles. The sounder is only fitted in certain markets and is mandatory fit in the UK..</p>
<p>On vehicles with BBUS incorporates an integrated tilt sensor which monitors the vehicle attitude. The tilt sensor can detect if the vehicle is being moved, towed or raised and will communicate to the BCM/GWM in order to indicate a &lsquo;trigger&rsquo; to activate the alarm.</p>
<p>Operation (SET/UNSET) of the BBUS and tilt sensor is controlled by the BCM/GWM on the LIN 2 (Local Interconnect Network) bus. The BBUS is also connected with a permanent battery supply via the CJB (Central junction Box). An integral, rechargeable battery powers the BBUS if the vehicle battery supply from the CJB is interrupted.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Volumetric Sensor</h2>
<a name="illus6"></a>
<div class="zoom-image-wrapper">
<div class="image-box">
<a class="zoom-button popup-with-zoom-anim" href="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E134263\en_US\large_img"><i class="fa fa-search-plus"></i></a><img class="example-image" alt="E134263" src="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E134263\en_US\_img"></div>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>The volumetric sensor is mandatory in some markets, an optional fitment in some markets and is not available in other markets. The volumetric sensor comprises two sensors which allow the interior of the vehicle to be monitored. The module is located in a central position in the front overhead console.</p>
<p>Double Locking Vehicles - The volumetric sensors are activated when the vehicle is double locked. The vehicle can be locked and alarmed with the volumetric sensors deactivated if a pet is to be left in the vehicle for example, by single locking the active anti-theft system.</p>
<p>When volumetric sensors are active, if the vehicle battery voltage falls to below 9 volts, the BCM/GWM will ignore any inputs from the sensors to prevent false alarm activation.</p>
<p>The BCM/GWM ignores the signals from the volumetric sensor for the first 30 seconds to allow time for the vehicle interior to settle and prevent false alarm activation.</p>
<p>If the tailgate is opened via the smart key, the volumetric sensor and the tilt sensor are inhibited until the tailgate is closed.</p>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">OPERATION</div>
</div>
<p>The BCM/GWM automatically arms and disarms the active anti-theft system when it operates the CDL via an external lock/unlock request &ndash; Smart Key lock/unlock switch press or Keyless Vehicle Exterior Lock switch press or unlock request via exterior handle pull.</p>
<p>On vehicles without a volumetric sensor, only the perimeter sensing is available to monitor the vehicle apertures.</p>
<p>When perimeter sensing is active, the BCM/GWM monitors aperture ajar switches located in the latch mechanisms of the front and rear doors, the tailgate and hood ajar micro switch, located in hood latch mechanism in the engine compartment.</p>
<p>When volumetric sensors are active, the BCM/GWM monitors the interior of the vehicle for movement using a volumetric sensor located in the front overhead console.</p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">Arming</span>
</p>
<p>On vehicles without a volumetric sensor or tilt sensor, the active anti-theft system is armed in the perimeter sensing 'mode' when the vehicle is either locked or double locked.</p>
<p>On vehicles fitted with a volumetric sensor, the system has 2 modes of operation; perimeter sensing and volumetric sensing.</p>
<p>On vehicles fitted with a volumetric sensor and tilt sensor, the system has 2 modes of operation; perimeter sensing and volumetric/tilt sensing.</p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">Perimeter Sensing</span>
</p>
<p>Perimeter sensing only monitors the hinged panels and validity of the smart key in the start control module. Perimeter mode is activated by a single press of the lock switch on the smart key.</p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">Volumetric Sensing</span>
</p>
<p>Volumetric mode monitors the vehicle interior for intrusion. If the vehicle is fitted with a BBUS, which incorporates a tilt sensor, the vehicle attitude is also monitored when volumetric sensing is active. On Double Locking Vehicles volumetric sensing is activated by a second press of the lock switch on the smart key/Keyless vehicle exterior lock switch. The second press of the switch must occur within 3 seconds of the first press. The second press of the lock switch also activates the perimeter mode double locking feature.</p>
<p>On Single Locking, vehicles where volumetric sensors are fitted, Volumetric Sensing is activated by a single press of the lock switch on the smart key/Keyless vehicle exterior lock switch.</p>
<p>The BCM/GWM arms the active anti-theft system when it single locks or double locks the vehicle, providing all the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>All doors, tailgate and hood are closed.</li>
<li>The BCM/GWM is not in transit mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the vehicle has successfully completed its locking routine, confirmation will be given by a single short flash of the turn signal indicators to indicate a single locked condition. If double locking is activated, then the confirmation will be given by a double flash of the turn signal indicators; one short flash for locked and one long flash on completion of double locked.</p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">Mislock</span>
</p>
<p>If any doors, tailgate or hood is open/ajar, or if the ignition is ON, when a lock or double lock request is received, the anti-theft alarm system remains disarmed and the BCM/GWM generates a short mislock sound from the security sounder (BBUS or Passive Sounder) and the turn signal indicators will not flash. Each attempt to lock will be confirmed by an audible chime being emitted.</p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">Disarming</span>
</p>
<p>The BCM/GWM will disarm the active anti-theft system to prevent false alarm activation under certain conditions as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>When the active anti-theft system is armed in volumetric mode, if the vehicle battery voltage decreases to less than 9 volts, the BCM/GWM will disable the volumetric mode and remain in perimeter mode only. This prevents false alarm activation because the volumetric sensor cannot operate correctly below 9 volts.</li>
<li>On vehicles fitted with a BBUS, if the vehicle battery voltage decreases from 9.5 to 9 volts in more than a 30 minute period, the BCM/GWM de-activates the BBUS and, if required, will use the vehicle horns to sound an audible alarm trigger warning. This prevents false alarm activation. At voltages below 9 volts, the BCM/GWM will not generate the 'heartbeat' signal to the BBUS. The BBUS interprets this as the CJB has been tampered with and activates its sounder. If the battery voltage subsequently rises to more than 9.5 volts, the BCM/GWM will re-arm the BBUS.</li>
<li>If the vehicle is unlocked using the unlock switch on the smart key and, within 40 seconds a hinged panel is not opened, the BCM/GWM automatically re-locks the vehicle and re-arms the active anti-theft system. This prevents leaving the vehicle unlocked and disarmed by accidental operation of the smart key unlock switch.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">Alarm</span>
</p>
<p>When the alarm is triggered, the BCM/GWM activates audible and visual warnings. The audible warnings are produced by the security sounders - Passive sounder or the BBUS and vehicle horns (market dependent). Visible indications are produced using the turn signal indicators.</p>
<p>The BCM/GWM activates the security sounders - Passive sounder or the BBUS and vehicle horns (market dependent) and the visual indications for 30/60 seconds, depending on the market. The activation is stopped for 10 seconds and, if the alarm trigger is still present, the BCM/GWM will cycle again for 30/60 seconds. This will be repeated for up to a maximum of 10 cycles per trigger source (3 cycles in certain markets) of 30/60 seconds for any one arming period. The BCM/GWM will ignore the trigger cause if the 10 cycles (3 cycles in certain markets) have been completed and the alarm trigger is still present or until it receives a disarm signal.</p>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTE:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<p>If the BBUS (Battery Back Up Sounder) is triggered due to tamper detection, the visual indication using the turn signal indicators is not activated.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The alarm can be triggered by any of the hinged panels being opened or doors unlocked, the volumetric sensor detects a movement inside the vehicle, the tilt sensor detects vehicle movement or an ignition tamper is detected (invalid smart key).</p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">Battery Back Up Sounder (BBUS)</span>
</p>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTE:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<p>If a BBUS is fitted, it is also armed with the perimeter mode lock request. However, the tilt functionality is not enabled in perimeter mode.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>On receipt of the arming signals, the BBUS and the tilt sensor respond with a status message. If the BCM/GWM does not receive the status signals within a period of time, the BCM/GWM assumes there is a fault and responds with a disarm signal to either the sounder and/or the tilt sensor and stores a related fault code. If the sounder is disarmed when the active anti-theft system is armed and the system is subsequently triggered, the CJB still energizes the horn relay and uses the vehicle horns to sound the audible warning in place of the sounder.</p>
<p>When the sounder is armed, the BCM/GWM sends a periodic (heartbeat) signal to the sounder which prompts the sounder to monitor the vehicle battery supply and the LIN bus link with the BCM/GWM. The sounder will operate if:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>It receives an alarm signal from the BCM/GWM or the tilt sensor.</li>
<li>The power supply or the LIN bus link to the BCM/GWM is disrupted.</li>

<p>The tilt sensor measures the longitudinal and lateral angle of the vehicle over a range of &plusmn;16 degrees from the horizontal. When the active anti-theft system is armed in volumetric mode, the tilt sensor stores the current vehicle angles in its memory and monitors the tilt sensor readings. If the vehicle angle changes in either direction by more than the alarm limit threshold, the tilt sensor communicates to the BCM/GWM in order to activate the alarm sounder.</p>
<p>If the alarm system is active and the battery or the BBUS is disconnected, the BBUS will continue to sound without the visual indication of the turn signal indicators flashing.</p>
