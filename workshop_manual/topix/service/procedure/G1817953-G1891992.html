<div class="grey-heading">OVERVIEW</div>
</div>
<p> The ZF 8HP45 transmission is an electronically controlled, hydraulically operated, 8 speed automatic unit. The hydraulic and electronic control elements of the transmission, including the Transmission Control Module (TCM), are incorporated in a single unit located inside the transmission and is known as Mechatronic valve block.</p>
<p>The ZF 8HP45 transmission has the following features:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Designed to be maintenance free</li>
<li>Automatic Transmission Fluid (ATF) is 'fill for life' </li>
<li>The torque converter features a controlled slip feature with electronically regulated control of lock-up, creating a smooth transition to the fully locked condition </li>
<li>Shift programs controlled by the TCM</li>
<li>Adaptive Shift Strategy (ASIS), to provide continuous adaptation of shift changes to suit the driving style of the driver, which can vary from sporting to economical</li>
<li>Connected to the Engine Control Module (ECM) via the High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) powertrain systems bus for communications</li>
<li>Default mode if major faults occur</li>
<li>Diagnostics available from the TCM via the HS CAN powertrain bus</li>
<li>Reduced weight</li>
<li>Optimized to engine torque.</li>
</ul>
<p>The transmission selections are made using the rotary Transmission Control Switch (TCS) in the floor console.For additional information, refer to: External Controls (307-05, Description and Operation).</p>
<p>On vehicles featured with Start/Stop system, the 8HP45 Automatic Transmission is fitted with a Hydraulic Impulse Storage (HIS) device to ensure ATF is available to the shift elements as quickly as possible when the engine is started.</p>

<div class="grey-heading">SYSTEM OPERATION</div>
</div>
<h2>POWER FLOWS</h2>
<p>Operation of the transmission is controlled by the TCM, which electrically activates various solenoids to control the transmission gear selection. The sequence of solenoid activation is based on programmed information in the TCM memory and physical transmission operating conditions such as vehicle speed, throttle position, engine load and TCS position.</p>
<p>All gear shifts from 1st to 8th and 8th to 1st are known as 'overlap' shifts. Overlap shifts are during a gear shift and one clutch must remain capable of transmitting torque at a reduced main pressure until the other clutch is ready to accept the torque.</p>
<p>Engine torque is transferred, via operation of single or combinations of clutches to the 4 planetary gear trains. All gear trains are controlled by reactionary inputs from brake clutches to produce the 8 forward gears and 1 reverse gear. The ratios are as follows:</p>

<span class="bold-black">MESSAGE CENTER</span>
</p>
<p>The message center is located in the IC. The message center is a Thin Film Transistor (TFT) display that relays vehicle status and operating information to the driver and can display messages relating to a number of vehicle systems. If a transmission fault occurs, the message GEARBOX FAULT is displayed in the message center. For additional information, refer to: Instrument Cluster (413-01 Instrument Cluster, Description and Operation).</p>
<h2>Transmission Control Module (TCM)</h2>
<p>The TCM outputs signals to control the shift control solenoid valves and the Electronic Pressure Regulating Solenoid (EPRS)'s to control the hydraulic operation of the transmission.</p>
<p>The TCM processes signals from the transmission speed and temperature sensors, the TCS, the ECM and other vehicle systems. From the received signal inputs and pre-programmed data, the TCM calculates the correct gear, torque converter clutch setting and optimum pressure settings for gear shift and lock-up clutch control.</p>
<p>The ECM supplies the engine management data over the HS CAN powertrain systems bus. The TCM requires engine data to efficiently control the transmission operation, for example; flywheel torque, engine speed, accelerator pedal position, engine coolant temperature. The ABS (Anti-lock Brake System) control module also supplies data to the TCM on the HS CAN powertrain systems bus. The ABS control module receives the steering angle data from the Steering Angle Sensor Module (SASM) via the HS CAN chassis systems bus, converts the message and forward it to the TCM via the HS CAN powertrain systems bus. The TCM uses data from these systems to suspend gear changes when the vehicle is cornering and/or the ABS is controlling braking or traction control.</p>
<p>The Body Control Module/GateWay Module (BCM/GWM) supplies steering wheel paddle data over the HS CAN powertrain systems bus. The TCM uses this to schedule driver requested upshifts and downshifts.</p>
<p>Using the signal inputs and the memorized data, the TCM control program computes the correct gear and torque converter lock-up clutch setting and the optimum pressure settings for gear shift and lock-up clutch control. Special output-side modules (power output stages, current regulator circuits), allow the TCM to control the solenoid valves and pressure regulators and consequently precisely control the hydraulics of the automatic transmission. In addition, the amount and duration of engine interventions are supplied to the engine management by way of the HS CAN powertrain systems bus.</p>
<p>The TCM determines the position of the TCS using signals from the TCS on the HS CAN powertrain systems bus and a hardwired connection for the 'P' (Park) position determination.</p>
<p>The TCM transmits the position of the TCS and any manual gear selected on the HS CAN powertrain systems bus. This information is shown in the transmission status display in the IC.</p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">Engine Stall</span>
</p>
<p>If the vehicle stalls it will coast down in gear, with the transmission providing drive to the engine. A restart can be attempted at this point and the engine may start and the driver can continue.</p>
<p>If the coast down speed reduces such that the speed of the engine is less than 400 RPM, the transmission will go to neutral, D illumination will flash in the IC. The driver needs to select neutral or park and then press the brake pedal to restart the engine.</p>
<p>If the Stop/start switch is pressed when driving, the message <span class="bold-black">'ENGINE STOP BUTTON PRESSED'</span> is displayed in the message center but there will be no change to the ignition state. If the driver requires to switch off the engine, the Stop/start switch must be pressed for a second time. The engine will be stopped and will be back driven by the transmission as the vehicle coasts down.</p>
<h2>COMPONENT DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>The transmission comprises the main casing which houses all of the transmission components. The main casing also incorporates an integral torque converter housing.</p>
<p>A fluid pan is attached to the lower face of the main casing and is secured with bolts. The fluid pan is sealed to the main casing with a gasket. Removal of the fluid pan allows access to the Mechatronic valve block. The fluid pan has magnets located at the rear which collect any ferrous metallic particles present in the ATF. </p>
<p>A fluid filter is located inside the fluid pan. If the ATF becomes contaminated or after any service work, the fluid pan with integral filter must be replaced.</p>
<p>The transmission does not have a Bowden cable for park lock operation. This is initiated electronically when the TCS is moved to the 'P' position. An emergency park interlock release mechanism is provided to release the park interlock if a failure occurs. For additional information, refer to: External Controls (307-05, Description and Operation).</p>
<p>A feature of the 8 speed transmission is decoupling of the transmission when the vehicle is at a standstill. Normally the transmission remains in gear with the torque converter slipping and the vehicle is prevented from moving by applying the brake. The new system disengages one of the transmission clutches and only a minimum rotating load remains. This has the effect of further reducing fuel consumption.</p>
<p>The internal fluid pump is driven by a simplex chain and 2 drive gears from the torque converter. The fluid pump is a double stroke vane cell pump which delivers 50 cm&sup3; of ATF per revolution.</p>
<p>The integral torque converter housing provides protection for the torque converter assembly and also provides the attachment for the transmission to the engine. The torque converter is a non-serviceable assembly which also contains the lock-up clutch mechanism.</p>
<p>The main casing contains the following major components:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Input shaft</li>
<li>Output shaft</li>
<li>Mechatronic valve block which contains the solenoids, speed sensors and the TCM</li>
<li>Three rotating multiplate drive clutches</li>
<li>Two fixed multiplate brake clutches</li>
<li>Four planetary gear trains.</li>

</div>
<p>The 8HP45 transmission is fitted with a twin torsional damper torque converter. The damper enables a more direct engine connection for highly efficient power transmission when starting and shifting. The inner spring set is connected directly to the transmission, the outer spring set responds to torque from the engine via the lock-up clutch. When the lock-up clutch is applied, the hydro-dynamic circuit is by-passed and torque is transferred directly to the transmission input shaft. In comparison to conventional torque converters, the twin torsional damper applies the lock-up clutch earlier, therefore improving driving comfort at low engine speeds and increasing fuel efficiency by enabling the engine to be operated at lower RPM levels.</p>
<p>When the converter lock-up clutch is not applied, torque is transferred hydro-dynamically. Power from the engine is transmitted via the pump and turbine to the transmission input shaft. When the converter lock-up clutch is applied, the hydro-dynamic circuit is by-passed, torque is transferred directly via the lock-up clutch and the twin spring sets. The turbine inertia is coupled between the two spring sets which improves disengagement, helps reduce wear on the transmission and improve noise insulation.</p>
<p>The torque converter is the coupling element between the engine and the transmission and is located in the torque converter housing, on the engine side of the transmission. The driven power from the engine crankshaft is transmitted hydraulically and mechanically through the torque converter to the transmission. The torque converter is connected to the engine by a flex plate attached to the rear of the crankshaft.</p>
<p>The torque converter comprises a twin torsional damper, an impeller, a stator and a turbine. The torque converter is a sealed unit with all components located between the converter housing cover and the impeller. The two components are welded together to form a sealed, fluid filled housing. With the impeller brazed to the converter housing cover, the impeller is therefore driven at engine crankshaft speed.</p>
<p>The converter housing drive plate has four threaded bosses, which provide for attachment of the engine flex plate. The threaded bosses also provide for location of special tools which are required to remove the torque converter from the torque converter housing.</p>

<p>For GTDi and AJ200D Ingenium engines the transmission has fitted with a different torque converter, which incorporates a pendulum mass to isolate engine torsionals and improve Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH).</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Lock-Up Clutch</h2>
<p>The torque converter lock-up clutch is hydraulically controlled by an EPRS, which is controlled by the TCM. This allows the torque converter to have three states of operation as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Fully engaged</li>
<li>Controlled slip variable engagement</li>
<li>Fully disengaged.</li>
</ul>
<p>The torque converter pressure valve reduces system pressure and guarantees the pressure needed for the torque converter. It also limits the maximum torque converter pressure, to prevent the torque converter from expanding.</p>
<p>The EPRS is operated by Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals from the TCM to give full, partial or no lock-up of the torque converter.</p>
<p>The lock-up clutch is a hydro-mechanical device which eliminates torque converter slip, improving fuel consumption. The engagement and disengagement is controlled by the TCM to allow a certain amount of controlled 'slip'. This allows a small difference in the rotational speeds of the impeller and the turbine which results in improved shift quality. The lock-up clutch comprises a piston and a clutch friction plate.</p>
<p>In the unlocked condition, the oil pressure supplied to the piston chamber is reduced and the pressure in the turbine chamber is allowed to push the piston back. In this condition the clutch plate are released and torque converter slip is permitted.</p>
<p>In the locked condition, the lock-up clutch spool valves are actuated by the EPRS. Pressurized ATF is directed into the lock-up clutch piston. The piston moves with the pressure and pushes the clutch plates together. As the pressure increases, the friction between the clutch plates increases, finally resulting in full lock-up of the clutch plates. In this condition there is direct mechanical drive from the engine crankshaft to the transmission planetary gear train.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Transmission Idle Control feature is a standstill decoupling feature for the 8 speed transmission. When the vehicle comes to a standstill with the brakes applied and the TCS is in 'D' (Drive) position, the converter is disconnected from the driveline so that only a slight residual load remains. This further reduces fuel consumption. Decoupling is by actuating clutch B in the transmission, and is dependent on load and output speed.</p>
<h2>AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION FLUID (ATF) PUMP</h2>
<p>The ATF pump is an integral part of the transmission. The ATF pump is used to supply hydraulic pressure for the operation of the control valves and clutches, to pass the fluid through the transmission cooler and to lubricate the gears and shafts.</p>
<p>The ZF 8HP45 ATF pump is a double stroke, vane type pump and is located below the transmission input shaft. The pump is driven by a chain drive from a sprocket located on the input shaft. The pump has a delivery rate of 50 cm&sup3; per revolution. The drive sprocket is driven at engine speed through a splined connection in the torque converter shell.</p>

<p>The ATF pump comprises a sprocket, a rear cover with bearing, a front cover with bearing, a cylinder, a rotor shaft and a rotor with vanes. A Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) is fitted in the pressure outlet gallery from the pump but is not an integral part of the pump itself.</p>
<p>A sprocket is located around the transmission input shaft. Splines on the torque converter nose and the sprocket ensure a positive drive. A simplex chain transmits the rotation of the torque converter cover into rotation of the pump rotor shaft via a second sprocket fitted to the rotor shaft. The gearing of the two sprockets rotates the pump rotor shaft at a speed slightly higher than the Revolutions Per minute (RPM) of the torque converter cover which is directly connected to the engine crank.</p>
<p>The pump contains 7 vanes which are attached to the rotor and rotate within the cam shaped cylinder. As the vanes rotate, the eccentricity of the central hole in the cylinder causes the space between the vanes to increase. This causes a depression between the vanes and fluid is drawn into the space between the vanes via a suction port connected to the fluid pan. The fluid passes through the fluid pan filter before it is drawn into the pump.</p>
<p>As the rotor shaft rotates further, the inlet port is closed by the vanes which have drawn in fluid, trapping the fluid in the space between the vanes. The eccentric hole in the cylinder causes the space between the vanes to decrease and consequentially compresses and pressurizes the fluid trapped between them.</p>
<p>Further rotation of the rotor shaft moves the vanes towards the outlet port. As the vanes pass the outlet port the pressurized fluid passes from the space between the vanes into the pressure gallery to the pressure relief valve.</p>
<p>As the ATF pump is a double stroke vane pump, this sequence is repeated twice per revolution of the rotor shaft.</p>
<p>The PRV controls the pressure and flow of fluid delivered to the transmission Mechatronic valve block, torque converter and other components. Pressure is controlled by a relief valve which limits the maximum system pressure to 32 bar (464 lbf/in&sup2;). The pressure control maintains a constant pressure of fluid irrespective of torque converter input shaft rotational speed. A metering orifice is subject to the pump output pressure. If the pressure in the orifice reaches a predetermined level, a spring loaded ball in the flow control valve is lifted from its seat and pressurized fluid is allowed to recirculate through the pump.</p>
<h2>MECHATRONIC VALVE BLOCK</h2>
<p>The Mechatronic valve block is located in the bottom of the transmission and is covered by the fluid pan. The valve block houses the TCM, electrical actuators, speed sensors, control valves and the HIS which provide all electro-hydraulic control for all transmission functions. The Mechatronic valve block comprises the following components: </p>

<p>Seven EPRS are located in the valve block. The solenoids are controlled by PWM signals from the TCM. The solenoids convert the electrical signals into hydraulic control pressure proportional to the signal to actuate the spool valves for precise transmission operation.</p>
<p>Solenoids EPRS A, B, D, E and WK supply a higher control pressure as the signal amperage increases and can be identified by an orange connector cap. The TCM operates the solenoids using PWM signals. The TCM monitors engine load and clutch slip and varies the solenoid duty cycle accordingly. The solenoids have a 12 V operating voltage and a pressure range of 0 - 4.7 bar (0 - 68 lbf/in&sup2;).</p>
<p>Solenoids EPRS C and SYS supply a lower control pressure as the signal amperage increases and can be identified by a gray connector cap.

<p>A control solenoid MV 2 (Magnetic Valve 2) is located in the valve block. The solenoid is controlled by the TCM and converts electrical signals into hydraulic control signals to control the electronic park lock function.</p>
<p>The control solenoid is an on/off solenoid which is controlled by the TCM by switching the solenoid to earth.</p>
<p>When the 'P' position is deselected, control solenoid MV2 resets the parking lock valve in the Mechatronic valve block. This is achieved by the TCM providing the ground for the solenoid which is energized, releasing the claws from retaining the park lock piston. Main fluid pressure acting on the parking lock piston, pushes the piston back to release the lock.</p>
<p>When the 'P' position is selected, control solenoid MV2 is de-energized. The fluid pressure at the parking lock cylinder piston is vented and the mechanical interlock of the piston is opened. A pre-tensioned torsion spring at the park lock disc pulls the piston into the 'P' position where the piston engages with the control solenoid claws and is locked in the park position. An EPR (Emergency Park Release) cable can be used to release the parking lock manually if an electrical failure occurs.</p>
<p>The resistance of the solenoid coil winding for solenoid is 25 Ohms at 20 &deg;C (68 &deg;F).</p>
<p>When the 'N' (neutral) position is selected and the engine is turned off, the fluid pressure at the park lock cylinder piston is released. The current supply to the control solenoid MV2 remains. The park lock cylinder piston is still held in the unlocked position by the spring force acting on the park lock disc, preventing the park lock plate from engaging the parking lock. This allows the vehicle to be moved when the engine is not running for a short time. Should the battery voltage fall below the level required to maintain the solenoid in the energized condition, the park lock will be engaged.</p>

<p>Following an ECO stop, the vehicle must be able to restart and drive away within a very short period of time, less than 400ms from the point of the engine starting. The transmission must also be able to react in this time. When the engine is not running the ATF pump is not operating and fluid pressure decays to zero and the brake and clutch elements unlock. When the engine is re-started, the transmission ATF pump requires approximately 800ms to provide the fluid volume and pressure required to engage the shift elements. The HIS system overcomes this by providing fluid pressure quickly to the shift elements during the engine start process within the engine start time parameter.</p>

<p>The HIS system comprises a cylindrical accumulator which contains an electro-mechanical locking unit, a spring actuated piston and a one-way restrictor. The accumulator is located at the rear of the Mechatronic valve block and is secured in position with 3 screws and sealed into a port in the transmission casing with an O-ring seal.</p>
<p>The electro-mechanical locking unit comprises a low-current solenoid, a spring loaded keeper incorporating a magnetic core and a number of balls. The keeper has a detent into which the balls locate during filling of the HIS when the engine is running and the ATF pump is producing pressure.</p>
<p>The one-way restrictor is located in the inlet/outlet port of the accumulator. The restrictor provides a controlled charging of the HIS, to allow a small volume flow of ATF. This ensures that the operation of the transmission shift elements are not compromised by a sudden drop in ATF pressure. The restrictor allows a charging time for the HIS of approximately 5 seconds. When discharge is required, the restrictor allows full flow from the cylinder.</p>
<p>The filling process for the HIS has several steps:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>When the engine is running and the ATF pump is producing pressure, the one-way restrictor allows a controlled flow of ATF which acts on the piston.</li>
<li>The ATF pressure moves the piston into the accumulator cylinder. A locking ring on the piston passes over the balls which are at this point located in the keeper detent.</li>
<li>As the piston continues to move, a spring in the center of the keeper moves the locking cylinder and the magnetic core towards the solenoid windings and into the final fully charged position. The energized solenoid holds the magnetic core and the balls are lifted from the detent by the movement of the keeper, locking the piston in the charged position. The HIS is now electro-mechanically locked and ready for an engine stop to occur.</li>
<li>When the engine is stopped, the ATF pump also stops and ATF pressure is decayed. The pressure acting on the piston is also decayed and the piston moves to be held in the locked position by the balls. The energy required for hydraulic filling during engine start is now stored in the tensioned piston spring. The solenoid remains energized to hold the keeper in position and the balls out of the detent to lock the piston.</li>

<p>There are three drive clutches and two brakes used in the transmission. Each clutch comprises a number of friction plates dependent on the output controlled. A typical clutch consists of a number of alternating steel plates and plates with friction material bonded to each face.</p>
<p>The clutch plates are held apart mechanically by a diaphragm spring and hydraulically by dynamic pressure. The pressure is derived from a lubrication channel which supplies fluid to the bearings and clutch cooling. The fluid is passed via a drilling in the input shaft into the chamber between the baffle plate and the piston. To prevent inadvertent clutch application due to pressure build up produced by centrifugal force, the fluid in the dynamic pressure equalization chamber overcomes any centrifugal pressure in the piston chamber and holds the piston off the clutch plate assembly.</p>
<p>When clutch application is required, main pressure from the fluid pump is applied to the piston chamber from the supply port. This main pressure overcomes the low pressure fluid present in the dynamic pressure equalization chamber. The piston moves, against the pressure applied by the diaphragm spring, and compresses the clutch plate assembly. When the main pressure falls, the diaphragm spring pushes the piston away from the clutch plate assembly, disengaging the clutch.</p>
<h2>PLANETARY GEAR TRAINS</h2>
<p>The 8 forward gears and the reverse gear are produced by a combination of four simple planetary gear sets, 3 clutches and 2 brakes. The front two gear sets share a common sun gear. Power is output always through the planetary carrier of the fourth gearset.</p>
<p>Five shift elements comprising 3 clutches and 2 brakes, are responsible for all 8 forward and reverse gears. High efficiency is achieved by the use of only 2 shift elements disengaged in each gear which reduces drag and so increases the efficiency.</p>
