</div>
<p>The deployable towbar is located behind the rear bumper. The deployable towbar assembly replaces the armature normally found behind the bumper.</p>
<p>The electrically operated deployable towbar is stowed under the vehicle, and is deployed using a deployable towbar switch located on the right side of the luggage compartment. The switch sends a signal to a Deployable Towbar Control Module (DTCM), located adjacent to the primary battery, to deploy/stow the towbar.</p>
<p> The deployable towbar system is integrated into the vehicle electrical systems and the DTCM communicates with other vehicle control modules through the medium speed Controller Area Network (CAN) body systems bus. The DTCM also controls the trailer lights in addition to operating the deployable towbar.</p>

<p>The deployable towbar comprises a fabricated steel cross beam which replaces the armature located behind the bumper. The cross beam is attached at each end to the vehicle body with four bolts and washers. The bolts screw into threaded holes in the vehicle body.</p>
<p>Brackets welded to the cross beam provide for bumper and rear valance attachment. </p>
<p>A pair of brackets are welded centrally on the cross beam. The deployable towbar mechanism is located between the brackets and secured with five bolts that screw into threaded mounting holes in the mechanism body. One of the brackets has an additional bracket to allow for the attachment of the trailer socket and its pivot mechanism.</p>
<p>The trailer socket is attached to a bracket on the cross beam with a shouldered bolt and nut. A spring located on the shouldered bolt, lowers the trailer socket when the deployable towbar is deployed. When the deployable towbar is stowed, a plate on the towbar arm pushes the trailer socket upwards to its stowed position.</p>

<p>The movement motor has a tapered gear wheel attached to the motor spindle. The gear wheel meshes with gear teeth on the arm. The gear teeth on the arm are shaped in a way that which rotates and lowers the arm as the motor operates. The motor is controlled by a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) output from the DTCM.</p>
<p>The movement motor contains a hall effect position sensor which is used by the DTCM to determine the position of the towbar arm in either the deployed or stowed positions. When the arm reaches either of the positions, the DTCM reduces the PWM output to slow the motor. As the towbar arm reaches the limit of its travel, the DTCM detects a current rise within the motor and stops the motor. The DTCM must receive the movement motor current increase within the correct range of position sensor pulses to determine the towbar arm is in the correct position.</p>

<p>The locking motor operates a threaded spindle. The spindle has two locking blocks which move along two threads on the spindle. The threads are left and right handed, driving the locking blocks in opposite directions when the motor is operated. The locking blocks are engaged or disengaged with flats on the arm.</p>
<p>The locking motor is controlled by a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) output from the DTCM. </p>
<p>The position of the locking blocks when unlocking is monitored by the DTCM using current measurement of the locking motor and pulses from a hall effect position sensor. The locking motor is operated, driving the locking blocks to the outer sides of the motor housing. When the locking blocks become near to the end of the spindle, the PWM output is reduced, slowing the spindle rotation. The locking block make contact with the motor housing causing a current increase in the motor. The DTCM detects the current increase and stops the locking motor. Once this condition is detected, the DTCM will operate the movement motor to deploy the towbar arm. During the unlocking, the pulses from the position sensor are monitored by the DTCM to determine the position of the locking blocks. Before the movement motor is operated, the DTCM must receive the locking motor current increase within the correct range of position sensor pulses.</p>
<p>When the movement motor moves the towbar arm to the deployed position, the DTCM determines that the towbar arm is in the fully deployed position by monitoring the current rise in the movement motor and measuring the pulses from the position sensor. Once the fully deployed position is detected, the DTCM initiates locking. The locking motor operates, rotating the spindle, moving both locking blocks towards the centre of the spindle. When sufficient pulses from the locking motor have been detected, the movement motor is turned off. The DTCM determines that the towbar arm is fully locked by monitoring the current rise in the locking motor and measuring the pulses from the position sensor.</p>
<p>The above procedure is repeated for both the stow and deploy functions.</p>

</div>
<p>The Deployable Towbar Control Module (DTCM) is located in the wheel well in the luggage compartment. The module is located on two studs and secured with nuts.</p>
<p>All functions of the deployable towbar are controlled by the DTCM which responds to user requests for stow and deploy from the deployable towbar switch. A LED warning indicator in the deployable towbar switch is controlled by the DTCM. The warning indicator is illuminated in various ways to advise the user that the towbar is operating correctly or a fault condition exists.</p>
<p>The DTCM also controls the deployable towbar speaker, providing the user with audible warnings to advise on towbar operating or fault conditions.</p>
<p>The trailer lamp test switch, which is integral with the deployable towbar switch, is also connected to the DTCM. The trailer lamp test switch allows the vehicle lights and the trailer lights to be checked for correct operation by the user without assistance.</p>
<p>The DTCM is connected to the vehicle electrical system on the medium speed Controller Area Network body systems bus.</p>
<p>Power for the DTCM is supplied via a fused connection from the Rear Junction Box (RJB).</p>
<p>Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) are stored in the DTCM and can be read using Jaguar approved diagnostic equipment.</p>
<p>The DTCM is able to communicate various status and fault indicators, via an audible warning from the deployable towbar speaker and the LED indicator in the deployable towbar switch. Details of these status indicator codes are shown in the following table:</p>

<p>The deployable towbar switch is located in the right side luggage compartment trim panel. The switch is a press fit and secured with spring clips.</p>
<p>The switch is connected to the DTCM with a six pin connector, only five of the pins are used. The connections are for switch illumination, LED warning indicator, deploy/stow selection, trailer lamp test selection and ground. The ground is connected back to the DTCM.</p>
<p>The deployable towbar switch has an LED warning indicator which is controlled by the DTCM. The DTCM can illuminate the warning indicator in a number of ways to provide visual indication to the user that the deployable towbar is operating or fault status exists. Refer to the above table for warning indicator illumination details.</p>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">OPERATION</div>
</div>
<h2>Deployable Towbar Control Module (DTCM)</h2>
<p>The deployable towbar only operates when the vehicle is stationary and the selected transmission gear position is Park or Neutral. Operating the deployable towbar switch in the luggage compartment (with the luggage compartment lid open) deploys the towbar. Once deployed, operating the deployable towbar switch stows the towbar under the vehicle. Whilst the towbar is operating, an audible warning is emitted from the deployable towbar speaker and an LED warning indicator in the deployable towbar switch flashes. Once fully deployed the audible warning stops and the LED warning indicator is permanently illuminated to indicate that the towbar has deployed and locked correctly.</p>
<p>To stop movement of the deployable towbar at any time, operate the deployable towbar switch. Operating the switch again resets the towbar to the deployed position.</p>
<p>If during deployment of the deployable towbar an obstruction occurs, the towbar movement will stop. The LED warning indicator will flash faster, accompanied by a 2 second warning beep. When the obstruction has been cleared, operating the deployable towbar switch re-sets the towbar.</p>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTE:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<p>Do not tow with the vehicle when the powered towbar is not fully deployed. If this action does occur, a warning beep sounds for 10 seconds.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the event of an unexpected operation, operating the deployable towbar switch re-sets the towbar. During the re-set operation, the deployable towbar carries out a full stow and deploy cycle.</p>
<p>If at any time during the deploy/stow movement, the deployable towbar switch is operated, the deployable towbar stops.</p>
<h2>Trailer Lamp Test Switch</h2>
<p>A trailer lamp test switch is located below the deployable towbar switch. A single press of the test switch initiates a 3 minute sequence, testing both the vehicle and trailer lamps.</p>
<p>When initiating the trailer lamp test, all the vehicle lamps and ignition must be switched off, and the Electric Park Brake (EPB) engaged. During the test, each trailer lamp, as well as the corresponding vehicle light, operates in turn. </p>
<p>The 3 minute test sequence can be stopped by any of the following actions:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Operating the trailer lamp test switch</li>
<li>Switching on the vehicle lamps</li>
<li>Switching the ignition on.</li>
