<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">PRELIMINARY ADVICE</p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">Symptom Driven Diagnostics (SDD)</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>During this Pre-Delivery inspection, certain sections of this manual require the use of the Jaguar Land Rover-approved diagnostics equipment Symptom Driven Diagnostics (SDD) software. Use the latest version of SDD available.</p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">Transportation Protection and Seals</span>
</p>
<p>Make sure the vehicle has arrived with all transportation protection intact and that there is no obvious indication of an attempt to enter the vehicle. All transportation protection, except for the brake disc transit protection bags, are to be removed when satisfied that the vehicle has arrived in a sealed state.</p>
<p>Where the exterior protection item (full body cover or partial covers) are not intact or damaged in transit such that retaining the cover could cause damage to the vehicles bodywork, or present any other risk, then the cover or partial cover should be removed using the following guidelines. </p>
<p>Where minor damage is present, unlikely to affect the vehicles bodywork, or present any other risk, then guidance should be sought from the Jaguar Land Rover transport quality team in the first instance. Once any cover has been removed or damaged, it should never be refitted to a vehicle. Neither should a new cover be fitted to a vehicle during transit. The covers are designed to only be fitted in Jaguar Land Rover-approved locations. Where required, please contact the Jaguar Land Rover transport quality team for disposal instructions. Refer to Section <span class="bold-black">&lsquo;INTRODUCTION - 'RECTIFICATION AND WARRANTY&rsquo;</span>, for further details regarding warranty claims and liability.</p>
<p>All transportation protection and seals are to be removed when the retailer is satisfied that the vehicle has arrived in a sealed state. When removing the cover avoid any contact of the zippers, hooks, adhesive tapes, and dirty exterior areas of the cover with the painted surface. Remove the separate hood cover as last step to avoid scratches on the hood when removing the body cover.</p>

</p>
<p>Make sure the correct standard of battery care is applied to the battery, For additional information, refer to: <a href="javascript:window.parent.loadProcedureById('G1938238','G2048226')" data-uid="G2048226" data-proc-uid="G1938238" title="Open the procedure inline and add to opened print list" class="inline-procedure-link">Battery Care Requirements</a> (414-00 Battery and Charging System - General Information, Description and Operation).</p>
<p>Whenever any work is carried out a Jaguar approved power supply must be connected to the vehicle.</p>
<p>For requirements for PDI/delivery to the customer, refer to the battery care requirements. For additional information, refer to: <a href="javascript:window.parent.loadProcedureById('G1938238','G2048226')" data-uid="G2048226" data-proc-uid="G1938238" title="Open the procedure inline and add to opened print list" class="inline-procedure-link">Battery Care Requirements</a> (414-00 Battery and Charging System - General Information, Description and Operation).</p>
<p>Battery voltage <span class="bold-black">must</span> be recorded during PDI and customer hand over. For additional information, refer to: <a href="javascript:window.parent.loadProcedureById('G1577077','G1891024')" data-uid="G1891024" data-proc-uid="G1577077" title="Open the procedure inline and add to opened print list" class="inline-procedure-link">New Vehicle Storage Form</a> (100-11 Vehicle Transportation Aids and Vehicle Storage, Description and Operation).</p>

<p>
<span class="bold-black">Touch Screen </span>
</p>
<p>The Touch Screen provides touch control of the vehicle Audio, Climate, Phone, Navigation, and Vehicle systems.</p>
<p>Throughout this document the console buttons surrounding the Touch Screen are referred to as hard-buttons and are to be pressed firmly. The Touch Screen menu buttons are referred to as soft-buttons and only require a short, light pressure to function. Do not use excessive pressure.</p>
<p>When operating the Touch Screen soft-buttons, always extend the tip of one finger and withhold the thumb and remaining fingers from the screen. Touching the screen with more than one finger at a time may cause false inputs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">Emergency Park Release System (EPR)</span> - Automatic transmission vehicles only</p>
<p>In the event of a vehicle transmission failure, a mechanical means of selecting neutral is required; an Emergency Park Release (EPR) provides this functionality. The operating lever is located in the engine compartment, and is secured to a bracket on the intake manifold (2.0L Ingenium diesel and 2.0L GTDi petrol engines) or a bracket attached to the left-side of the supercharger (3.0L SC V6 petrol engine).</p>
<p>In an emergency, the EPR hand lever can be operated to release the park pawl within the transmission. The park pawl will not be allowed to re-engage until the hand lever is locked down in the closed position.</p>
