<h2>EXTERIOR LIGHTING</h2>
<p>The exterior lighting consists of:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>two headlamp assemblies, each containing a:<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li class="dash-subitem">Headlamp</li>
<li class="dash-subitem">Static bending lamp</li>
<li class="dash-subitem">Turn signal indicator</li>
<li class="dash-subitem">Combined daytime running lamp and side lamp</li>
<li class="dash-subitem">Side marker lamp and reflector (NAS market vehicles only).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>two tail lamp assemblies, each containing a:<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li class="dash-subitem">Turn signal indicator</li>
<li class="dash-subitem">Tail lamp unit</li>
<li class="dash-subitem">Stop lamp</li>
<li class="dash-subitem">Side marker</li>
<li class="dash-subitem">Reverse lamp</li>
<li class="dash-subitem">Rear fog lamp</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a lighting control switch and steering column multifunction switch</li>
<li>Body Control Module/Gateway Module (BCM/GWM) assembly</li>
<li>a High Mounted Stop Lamp (HMSL)</li>
<li>front and rear height sensors (Xenon headlamps only)</li>
<li>two license plate lamps</li>
<li>auxiliary lighting switch</li>
<li>brake pedal switch</li>
<li>reverse lamp switch</li>
<li>an Image Processing Control Module (IPCM) (market dependant)</li>
<li>a hazard warning lamp switch</li>
<li>warning indicators</li>
<li>rain/light sensor</li>
<li>Battery Junction Box (BJB).</li>
</ul>
<p>The exterior lighting is controlled by the BCM/GWM assembly as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>control and monitoring of the exterior lamps including the turn signal indicators and hazard warning lamp functionality</li>
<li>monitoring and evaluation of control inputs from other system control modules and output of applicable messages in the Instrument Cluster (IC) message center.</li>
</ul>
<p>The BCM/GWM assembly is connected to the Medium Speed (MS) and High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) buses. The BCM/GWM assembly contains a microprocessor which performs the control, monitoring and evaluation of functions.</p>
<p>Driver lighting selections are made using the lighting control switch and left steering column multifunction switch, the rear fog lamp switch and the hazard warning lamp switch. The BCM/GWM assembly operates the stop lamps using the inputs from the brake pedal switch.</p>
<p>Depending on market specification, the lighting system may include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>an Auto High Beam (AHB) function, where the headlamps are automatically switched between low and high beam in response to signals from the IPCM</li>
<li>an autolamps function, where the exterior lights are automatically turned on or off in response to signals from the rain/light sensor used for automatic wiper operation. For additional information, refer to: <a href="javascript:window.parent.loadProcedureById('G1905194','G1892681')" data-uid="G1892681" data-proc-uid="G1905194" title="Open the procedure inline and add to opened print list" class="inline-procedure-link">Wipers and Washers</a> (501-16 Wipers and Washers, Description and Operation).</li>
</ul>
<p>Driver lighting selections using the left steering column multifunction switch are passed to the BCM/GWM assembly via the Steering Wheel Module (SWM) on a Local Interconnect Network (LIN) bus. The BCM/GWM assembly provides circuit protection for all exterior lighting circuits.</p>
<p>The lighting system has an autolamps function which is controlled by the BCM/GWM assembly on receipt of signals from the rain/light sensor located at the top of the windshield. The exterior lights are turned on or off in response to ambient light signals from the rain/light sensor on a LIN bus connection to the BCM/GWM assembly. The autolamps can also be activated when the windshield wipers are activated by signals from the rain/light sensor, or when the driver activates the wipers in the continuous wipe position for more than 20 seconds.</p>
<p>Three levels of headlamp specification are available:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>halogen</li>
<li>xenon</li>
<li>xenon with Adaptive Front lighting System (AFS).</li>
</ul>
<p> In certain markets the headlamps feature a static bending lamp which illuminates the area at the side of the vehicle when turning into driveways for example. Only the D3S xenon bulb and the xenon ballast resistor are serviceable, no other headlamp components are available individually. Failure of any Light Emitting Diode (LED) requires replacement of the complete lamp assembly.</p>
<p>The tail lamps comprise of an inner and an outer tail lamp assembly.</p>
<p>The outer lamp comprises:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>a reverse lamp</li>
<li>a turn signal indicator</li>
<li>tail lamp functions</li>
<li>a stop lamp</li>
<li>a side marker lamp (NAS market vehicles only)</li>
</ul>
<p>The inner lamp comprises</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>a fog lamp</li>
<li>tail lamp functions</li>
</ul>
<p>All versions of the headlamps have impact resistant polycarbonate lenses. Removable covers at the rear of the headlamps allow for bulb replacement. The headlamps require removal for bulb replacement.</p>
<p>The xenon headlamps use a D3S xenon bulb which operates in both low and high beam.</p>
<p>Static dynamic leveling is standard on all xenon headlamps. The static dynamic system uses height sensors equipped to the front and rear suspension which processes the height sensor signals and adjusts the headlamp vertical alignment accordingly.</p>
<p>Manual headlamp leveling is used only on vehicles equipped with halogen lamps. A rotary leveling thumbwheel is located in the auxiliary lighting switch in the Instrument Panel (IP), adjacent to the steering column. Halogen headlamps use a H3B bulb which operates in low beam.</p>
<p>Headlamp washer jets are a standard fitment on xenon headlamps. For additional information, refer to: <a href="javascript:window.parent.loadProcedureById('G1905194','G1892681')" data-uid="G1892681" data-proc-uid="G1905194" title="Open the procedure inline and add to opened print list" class="inline-procedure-link">Wipers and Washers</a> (501-16 Wipers and Washers, Description and Operation).</p>
<p>Turn signal indicators and high and low beam functions are controlled from the left steering column multifunction switch. The turn signal indicators have a lane change feature. A single press and release of the multifunction switch in either direction will operate the selected turn signal indicators for three cycles.</p>
<p>An IPCM system may also be equipped as an optional feature which automatically controls the high beam headlamps.</p>

<h2>HEADLAMP ASSEMBLIES</h2>
<p>Three headlamp variants are available depending on model specification:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>halogen</li>
<li>xenon</li>
<li>xenon with Adaptive Front lighting System (AFS).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each headlamp has one access cover at the rear and a turn signal indicator bulb holder. Access to the cover and/or bulb holder requires removal of the grille and headlamp screws. A release lever at the rear of the headlamp allows the headlamp assembly to be released from its guide slots in the headlamp mounting bracket and moved forwards to allow access to the cover and the turn signal indicator bulb. The cover is removed by rotating clockwise to allow access to the xenon or halogen bulb.</p>
<p>On NAS vehicles, the side marker lamp Light Emitting Diode (LED) is colored orange. The side marker lamp lens is designed so that light from the LED also illuminates the orange colored side marker reflector area at the side of the lamp without the need for an additional bulb.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title"> HEADLAMP LEVELING</p>
<p>Headlamp leveling provides for the adjustment of the vertical aim of the headlamps to minimize glare to other road users when the vehicle attitude changes due to vehicle loading.</p>
</div>
<p>Two types of headlamp leveling are available dependent on the type of headlamps equipped to the vehicle:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>manual headlamp leveling - halogen headlamps only</li>
<li>automatic headlamp leveling - xenon headlamps only.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">MANUAL HEADLAMP LEVELING - HALOGEN HEADLAMPS ONLY</p>
<p>The manual system comprises the following components:</p>
</div>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTE:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<p>Headlamp leveling is not available on NAS market vehicles with halogen headlamps.</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>two headlamp leveling motors</li>
<li>headlamp leveling rheostat rotary control.</li>
</ul>
<p>A rotary thumbwheel controller is located adjacent to the Instrument Panel (IP) dimmer control in the auxiliary lighting switch. The rotary thumbwheel controller is connected to a rheostat which gives a variable output to the headlamp leveling stepper motors. The motors respond to the output and move to adjust the headlamp vertical alignment as required.</p>
<p>Movement of the leveling rotary control produces a variable voltage output (hardwired connection). The motors react to the supplied voltage and move the headlamp to the requested position which relates to the supplied voltage from the leveling rotary control. The headlamps can be lowered from their unladen position to compensate for changes in vehicle attitude due to loading.</p>
<p>The control has four defined positions to compensate for a drop in height at the rear of the vehicle and avoid dazzle to oncoming drivers. The positions are defined as follows:</p>

</div>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">HEADLAMP DELAY</p>
<p>The BCM/GWM assembly controls a headlamp delay function which illuminates after the occupants leave the vehicle. The headlamp delay will operate on low beam headlamps only when the lighting control switch is in the AUTO position and the ignition is off (power mode 0) or in accessory (power mode 4).</p>
</div>
<p>The headlamp delay is activated when the lighting control switch is in the 'AUTO' position and the engine is switched off. The message center displays a 'HEADLIGHT DELAY' message and the low beam headlamps will be activated for a period of approximately 30, 60 or 120 seconds. After the delay period, the BCM/GWM assembly automatically switches off the delay function, extinguishing the headlamps. The delay period can be adjusted using the information and message center 'Vehicle Settings' menu. The feature can also be disabled using this menu.</p>
<p>The headlamp delay feature can also be switched on when approaching the vehicle or switched off by pressing the headlamp switch on the smart key.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">AUTOMATIC HEADLAMP LEVELING - XENON HEADLAMPS ONLY</p>
<p>Automatic headlamp leveling is only available on vehicles with xenon headlamps. The system is not a dynamic headlamp leveling system and changes in vehicle inclination due to positive and negative acceleration are not compensated.</p>
</div>
<p>Automatic headlamp leveling provides for the static, periodic adjustment of the vertical aim of the headlamps to minimize glare to other road users when the vehicle attitude changes due to loading.</p>
<p>Automatic headlamp leveling is controlled by the BCM/GWM assembly.</p>
<p>The headlamp leveling system comprises the following components:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>front and rear vehicle height sensors</li>
<li>two headlamp leveling, vertical adjustment motors</li>
<li>ignition in power mode 6 or above.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the left steering column multifunction switch is moved to the side lamp or headlamp position, a Local Interconnect Network (LIN) bus message is passed from the Steering Wheel Module (SWM) to the BCM/GWM assembly for the selected function. The BCM/GWM assembly then issues a 'lights on' message on the High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) powertrain systems bus.</p>
<p>Signals from the front and rear height sensors are used to periodically re-align the vertical aim of the headlamps to their optimum position.</p>

<p>The xenon headlamp operates as both a low and high beam unit. The unit comprises a reflector, an adaptor ring, the lens, a shutter controller and the xenon bulb, which together is an assembly known as the projector module. The projector module is installed in a carrier frame that allows the module to tilt for vertical movement of the headlamp beam. Vertical movement is controlled by an actuator, connected between the carrier frame and the projector module, operated by the BCM/GWM assembly for automatic headlamp leveling.</p>
<p>The reflector is curved and provides the mounting for the xenon bulb. The bulb locates in a keyway to ensure correct alignment in the reflector and is secured by a plastic mounting ring. The shutter controller is a solenoid which operates the shutter mechanism via a lever. The shutter is used to change the beam projection between low and high beam.</p>
<p>The xenon headlamps are controlled by the BCM/GWM assembly using a xenon bulb control module and a xenon bulb igniter for each headlamp. These provide the regulated power supply required to illuminate the xenon bulbs through their start-up phases of operation.</p>
<p>The xenon bulbs illuminate when an arc of electrical current is established between two electrodes within the bulb. The xenon gas sealed in the bulb reacts to the electrical excitation and the heat generated by the current flow produces the characteristic blue/white light.</p>
<p>To operate at full efficiency, the xenon bulb goes through three stages of operation before the output for continuous operation is achieved. The three phases are; start-up phase, warm-up phase and continuous phase.</p>
<p>In the start-up phase, the bulb requires an initial high voltage starting pulse of up to 28000 Volts in order to establish the arc. This high voltage starting pulse is produced by the igniter and, once the arc is established, the warm-up phase begins. During the warm-up phase, the xenon bulb control module regulates the supply to the bulb to 2.6 A which gives a lamp output of 75 W. While in this phase, the xenon gas begins to illuminate brightly and the environment within the bulb stabilizes, ensuring a continual current flow between the electrodes. Once the warm-up phase is complete, the xenon bulb control module changes to continuous phase. The supply voltage to the bulb is reduced and the operating power required for continual operation is reduced to 35 W. The process from start-up to continuous phase is completed in a very short time.</p>
<p>The Xenon Bulb Control Module (XBCM) (one per headlamp) receive an operating voltage from the BCM/GWM assembly when the headlamps are switched on. The XBCM regulate the power supply required through the phases of start-up.</p>
<p>The xenon bulb igniters (one per headlamp) generate the initial high voltage required to establish the arc. The igniters have integral coils which generate the high voltage pulses required for start-up. Once the xenon bulbs are operating, the igniters provide a closed circuit for the regulated power supply from the XBCM.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>STATIC BENDING LAMPS (AFS LED ONLY)</h2>
<p>The LED static bending lamps are designed to illuminate the direction of travel when cornering at low speeds. The static bending lamp functionality, which is controlled by the BCM/GWM, operates using inputs from the steering angle sensor and vehicle speed information from the ABS control module.</p>
<p>The static bending lamp is incorporated into the headlamp assembly. The design of the lens projects a spread of light from the vehicle at approximately 45 degrees to the vehicle axis. The static bending lamp uses LEDs located in the headlamp housing.</p>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTE:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<p>The static bending lamps are fitted and operational in Jaguar vehicles, but currently disabled in NAS market vehicles. It will be enabled when certified.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The static bending lamps operate with a steering angle sensor CAN bus signal which is received by the BCM/GWM. The BCM/GWM monitors this signal and vehicle speed and activates the static bending lamp LED. When the operation parameters of the lamp are reached, the BCM/GWM snaps the static bending lamp LED on.</p>
<p>When the lamp is switched off, the BCM/GWM fades the LED off by decreasing the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) voltage in a linear manner over a period of 1 second. The static bending lamps can only be active for a maximum of 3 minutes at any given time.</p>
<h2>ADAPTIVE FRONT LIGHTING SYSTEM (AFS)</h2>
<p>The Adaptive Front lighting System (AFS) headlamp assembly contains an additional carrier frame which provides a location for the horizontal actuator. The projector module has a central pivot point which allows the module to move horizontally in response to operation of the horizontal actuator.</p>
<p>The AFS actuators are bi-polar (two phase) Direct Current (DC) stepper motors which are driven by a power output from the AFS power module located in the headlamp assembly. Each stepper motor receives its position information from the Headlamp Leveling Control Module (HLCM) via the applicable AFS power module. When the actuators are powered to their requested positions, a holding current is applied to maintain the actuator position.</p>
<p>The actuators do not supply a positional feedback signal to the HLCM. Each stepper motor requires referencing each time the AFS system becomes active. When the AFS system is active, each vertical actuator is driven to the low beam position and each horizontal actuator is driven to an inboard position until a mechanical stop in the actuator is reached. Once the stop is reached a step counter in the HLCM is set to zero and the actuator is then powered to the operating position as determined by the AFS software.</p>
<p>The AFS is controlled by the BCM/GWM assembly. The BCM/GWM assembly can process and control the headlamp leveling and the AFS headlamp systems. The BCM/GWM assembly is used on vehicles without AFS but fitted with xenon headlamps.</p>
<p>The system operates by the BCM/GWM assembly receiving inputs from the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) for engine running signal, the Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) control module for steering angle and vehicle speed and a reverse gear input from the transmission.</p>
<p>The BCM/GWM assembly processes these signals and provides an output to the headlamp leveling motors to adjust the headlamp horizontal aim according to vehicle speed and steering angle.</p>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTE:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<p> In markets with DRL, the AFS system will not operate when the DRL are active.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The BCM/GWM assembly is connected to the AFS headlamps on LIN bus. The BCM/GWM assembly calculates, using input data from other systems, the required position of the horizontal adjustment of the projector modules. The position information is then output on the LIN bus to the AFS headlamps. The BCM/GWM assembly outputs the appropriate signals to drive the AFS stepper motors in the headlamp to the appropriate position.</p>
<p>The horizontal position of the projector modules is dependent on a number of input variables. The position is determined by vehicle speed and steering angle. When reverse gear is selected, the projector modules are moved to the straight ahead position to avoid glare to other road users.</p>
<p>The angles of each projector module differ to give the correct spread of light, for example, when turning left, the left hand projector module will have a greater swivelling angle than the right hand projector module.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">FAILURE MODE</p>
<p>In the event of a failure of the AFS system, a warning indicator in the Instrument Cluster (IC) is illuminated to warn the driver. The AFS warning indicator illuminates when the ignition is in power mode 6 (ignition on) or greater. The AFS warning indicator will also be illuminated if a failure of the vehicle speed signal is detected.</p>
</div>
<p>Illumination of the AFS warning indicator does not necessarily mean that there is a fault with the AFS system.</p>
<p>The BCM/GWM assembly performs a diagnostic routine every time AFS is requested. If any fault is found, the BCM/GWM assembly will suspend the operation of the AFS function.</p>
<p>If the AFS levelling system has failed with the xenon projector module in a position other than the correct straight ahead position, the BCM/GWM assembly will attempt to drive the projector module to a position a small amount lower than the standard position.</p>
<p>The BCM/GWM assembly software can detect an internal failure of the BCM/GWM assembly control circuits. The BCM/GWM assembly will power the projector modules to the zero position and prevent further operation.</p>
<p>Faults can be investigated by interrogating the BCM/GWM assembly using a Jaguar approved diagnostic tool to check for fault codes.</p>

<p>The brake pedal switch is a two pole switch mounted in the brake pedal bracket and operated by the brake pedal. The output connections of the two poles are hardwired to the BCM/GWM assembly. The input connection of one pole is a hardwired signal feed from the BCM/GWM assembly. The input connection of the second pole is hardwired to ground. The BCM/GWM assembly compares the signals from the two poles to confirm the status of the brake pedal switch, which it uses to operate the stop lamps.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>HAZARD WARNING LAMPS</h2>
<p>The hazard warning lamps are controlled by a non-latching switch in the center of the IP. The hazard warning lamps operate at all times when selected and are not dependent on the ignition power mode. </p>
<p>When the hazard warning lamps are selected on, all of the turn signal indicators operate as previously described and both left and right turn signal indicators in the IC also flash. The hazard warning lamps flash at a rate of 400 ms on and 400 ms off. When the hazard warning lamps are active, they override any request for turn signal indicator operation.</p>
<p>The hazard warning lamps can also be activated by a crash signal from the Restraints Control Module (RCM). This is received by the BCM/GWM assembly which activates the hazard warning lamps. The hazard warning lamps can be cancelled when crash mode is cancelled by the RCM.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>TRAILER LIGHTING</h2>
<p>Several different types of trailer socket can be equipped to the vehicle depending on market specifications.</p>
<p>The BCM/GWM assembly monitors the turn signal indicators and can detect if more than two lamps are equipped. When a trailer is detected, the trailer warning indicator in the IC will flash in synchronization with the turn signal indicator.</p>
<p>If one or more of the turn signal indicators on the vehicle or the trailer are defective, the trailer warning indicator will not flash to alert the driver to the bulb failure.</p>

<p>The AFS warning indicator is activated by a HS CAN powertrain systems bus message from the BCM/GWM assembly to the IC. The remainder of the exterior lighting warning indicators are activated by the BCM/GWM assembly using HS CAN chassis systems bus messages to the IC.</p>

<h2>BODY CONTROL MODULE/GATEWAY MODULE (BCM/GWM) ASSEMBLY</h2>
<p>The BCM/GWM controls the exterior lighting system through interconnections as follow:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Left steering column multifunction switch</li>
<li>Side lamp position</li>
<li>Low beam position</li>
<li>Automatic ('AUTO') position (if equipped)</li>
<li>Rear fog lamp switch</li>
<li>Turn signal indicators</li>
<li>High beam switch</li>
<li>Headlamp flash</li>
<li>Brake pedal switch</li>
<li>Manual headlamp leveling control switch (halogen only)</li>
<li>Automatic headlamp leveling (Xenon and AFS LED)</li>
<li>Hazard warning lamp switch</li>
<li>Rain/light sensor.</li>
</ul>
<h2>CIRCUIT PROTECTION</h2>
<p>All exterior lighting circuits are protected by Field Effect Transistors (FETs), located in the BCM/GWM assembly, which can detect overloads and short circuits.</p>
<p>The FETs respond to heat generated by increased current flow caused by a short circuit. On a normal circuit this would cause the fuse to blow. The FETs respond to the heat increase and disconnect the supply to the affected circuit. When the fault is rectified or the FET has cooled, the FET will reset and operate the circuit normally. If the fault persists the FET will cycle, disconnecting and reconnecting the power supply. The BCM/GWM assembly stores fault codes which can be retrieved using a Jaguar approved diagnostic system. The fault code will identify that there is a fault on a particular output which assist in fault detection.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>ALARM INDICATIONS</h2>
<p>The exterior lighting system is used for arm and disarm requests. When the driver locks or unlocks the vehicle, a visual indication of a successful lock or unlock request is displayed to the driver by the hazard flashers.For additional information, refer to: <a href="javascript:window.parent.loadProcedureById('G1818046','G1892478')" data-uid="G1892478" data-proc-uid="G1818046" title="Open the procedure inline and add to opened print list" class="inline-procedure-link">Anti-Theft - Active</a> (419-01A Anti-Theft - Active, Description and Operation).</p>
<p></p>
<h2>LIGHTS-ON WARNING CHIME</h2>
<p>When the ignition is in the off (power mode 0) or auxiliary (power mode 4) mode and the left steering column multifunction switch is in the side lamp or low beam position, a warning chime will sound if the driver door is opened. This indicates to the driver that the exterior lights have been left on. The chime is generated from IC sounder on receipt of a lights-on signal, a door open signal and an ignition off signal from the BCM/GWM assembly.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>CRASH SIGNAL ACTIVATION</h2>
<p>In the event of an accident of a severity to activate and deploy the airbags, the RCM sends a request to the BCM/GWM assembly via the HS CAN powertrain systems bus to activate the hazard warning lamps. The hazard warning lamps will continue to operate until the ignition mode is changed to the auxiliary power mode 4, or the off power mode 0, or the RCM no longer transmits the crash signal.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>HEADLAMP DELAY TIMER</h2>
<p>The BCM/GWM assembly controls a headlamp delay function which illuminates the driveway after leaving the vehicle. The BCM/GWM assembly activates the low beam headlamps for the required delay period. The delay timer is set within the IC 'Vehicle Set-up Menu'. The default timing is 30 s, but the timing can be changed to between 0 s (OFF), 30 s (default), 60 s, 120 s and 240 s. For additional information, refer to: <a href="javascript:window.parent.loadProcedureById('G1905179','G1892305')" data-uid="G1892305" data-proc-uid="G1905179" title="Open the procedure inline and add to opened print list" class="inline-procedure-link">Information and Message Center</a> (413-08 Information and Message Center, Description and Operation).</p>
<p></p>
<h2>ADAPTIVE FRONT LIGHTING SYSTEM (AFS)</h2>
<p>When the BCM/GWM assembly receives an ignition on signal, the control module performs the initialization procedure which ensures that the headlamps are correctly aligned on both their vertical and horizontal axes.</p>
<p>The AFS swivel initialization starts less than 1 second after the headlamp levelling initialization is activated to ensure that the headlamps are at or below the 0 degree position in the vertical axis, thus preventing glare to oncoming vehicles. The AFS swivel initialization is completed in less than 2.5 seconds. The left and right AFS actuator motors are powered from the 0 degree position to a small movement to the inboard position, then another small movement to the outboard position and then back to the 0 degree position.</p>
