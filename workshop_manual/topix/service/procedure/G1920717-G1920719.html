<div class="caution-alert">CAUTION:</div>
<div class="caution-box">
<p>Diagnosis by substitution from a donor vehicle is <span class="bold-black">NOT</span> acceptable. Substitution of control modules does not guarantee confirmation of a fault, and may also cause additional faults in the vehicle being tested and/or the donor vehicle</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTES:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<ul class="wcn-list">
<li>
<p>If the control module or a component is suspect and the vehicle remains under manufacturer warranty, refer to the Warranty Policy and Procedures manual, or determine if any prior approval programme is in operation, prior to the installation of a new module/component</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generic scan tools may not read the codes listed, or may read only 5-digit codes. Match the 5 digits from the scan tool to the first 5 digits of the 7-digit code listed to identify the fault (the last 2 digits give extra information read by the manufacturer-approved diagnostic system)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When performing voltage or resistance tests, always use a digital multimeter accurate to three decimal places and with a current calibration certificate. When testing resistance, always take the resistance of the digital multimeter leads into account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check and rectify basic faults before beginning diagnostic routines involving pinpoint tests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inspect connectors for signs of water ingress, and pins for damage and/or corrosion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If diagnostic trouble codes are recorded and, after performing the pinpoint tests, a fault is not present, an intermittent concern may be the cause. Always check for loose connections and corroded terminals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where an 'on demand self-test' is referred to, this can be accessed via the 'diagnostic trouble code monitor' tab on the manufacturers approved diagnostic system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check DDW for open campaigns. Refer to the corresponding bulletins and SSMs which may be valid for the specific customer complaint and carry out the recommendations as required</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>The table below lists all diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) that could be logged in the integrated suspension control module, for additional diagnosis and testing information refer to the relevant diagnosis and testing section.

Move the sensor arm over the range &plusmn;40&deg; around the mid position and confirm that the voltage changes smoothly between around 0.2 volts and 4.8 volts.

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Inspect height sensor for damage or loose fixings. Confirm that the correct height sensor part number is installed, as specified in the service parts database</li>
<li>To check height sensor: disconnect electrical connector to height sensor and inspect connector pins &amp; terminals for evidence of corrosion or water ingress. If no corrosion found, disconnect harness at control module and follow the three steps below</li>
<li>Check for short circuits between any of the three terminals and vehicle ground. Repair circuit as required</li>
<li>Check for electrical continuity between the two connectors for each of the three terminals. Repair circuit as required. Reconnect electrical connector at control module only</li>
<li>Check voltages at terminals within height sensor connector (with sensor not connected): voltage to sensor ground connection should be ~0V, voltage to sensor signal connection should be ~0V, voltage to sensor supply connection should be ~5V. All voltages should be within &plusmn; 0.15V. Repair circuit as required, clear DTC and retest</li>
<li>To check sensor operation on the vehicle: Check for water ingress around the height sensors, electrical connectors or shaft end. Check for excessive movement in the shaft in all directions. Raise vehicle (ideally on wheels-free ramp) until suspension on corner under investigation is at full extension to gain access to height sensor. Access may be improved by removing road-wheel. Carefully disconnect the height sensor link from the upper suspension arm. Monitor the height sensor signal voltage output for the height sensor under investigation. Position the sensor arm so it is in the mid position and confirm that the voltage is around 2.5 volts. Move the sensor arm over the range &plusmn;40&deg; around the mid position and confirm that the voltage changes smoothly between around 0.2 volts and 4.8 volts. If voltages are incorrect or do not change smoothly then renew the sensor. NOTE: For angles of movement beyond &plusmn;40&deg;, the sensor signal will remain at a voltage of ~0.15V or
					~4.85V, depending on position of sensor lever. This is normal. When investigation is complete, install the height sensor link to the upper arm. If any fixings to the height sensor body or mounting bracket were slackened, found to be loose or if a height sensor was changed, the vehicle ride height MUST be re-calibrated. Refer to the relevant section of the workshop manual for the calibration procedure</li>
